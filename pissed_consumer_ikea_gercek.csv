"Dear IKEA Customer Service Team, I hope this message finds you well. My name is Limor Hefetz, and I am writing to file a complaint regarding the unacceptable and unprofessional service I experienced at the Buyback service desk at your Paramus, New Jersey, location on March 22nd. On March 8, 2025, we received a buyback estimation for our IKEA shelving unit in 'as new' condition (Estimation Number: 137****). On March 22nd, 2025, in order to facilitate the return, we proactively purchased appropriate wrapping materials and rented a U-Haul vehicle. Upon arrival at 1:05 PM, my husband was assisted by a representative named Cristina. Her initial attitude was aggressive, indifferent, and hostile. Despite acknowledging the excellent condition of our unit, she insisted that the bottom panels, which we had brought separately, be attached. My husband understood this requirement and was prepared to comply.",PissedConsumer_Global
"Our experience with Ikea has been so awful. First, they told us they had a rug in stock at their College Park store. By the time we got there, less than an hour later, they didn't have it. Then we ordered the rug and a rug pad online, and they arrived 3 days late. The rug pad was so thin and useless that we've been trying to return it. I paid for return shipping, and they told me to expect a delivery person between 9 am and 9 pm on July 11th.",PissedConsumer_Global
"The transporter called me half an hour before the time slot ended to tell me that he could not make the delivery (oven) necessary for the installation of the kitchen the next day. I lost one day waiting for him, and I have to take another day permit to wait for the oven after the kitchen has been installed. In addition, I lost another day because some pieces were delivered in advance on a different day from another vendor. IKEA never again.",PissedConsumer_Global
"My small-town post office doesn't deliver to homes; there are only PO Boxes, and if a package comes, they hold it for us. So I put in my PO Box number on my order, and unlike other websites that won't ship to PO Boxes and give you an error message SAYING SO, the Ikea website just lets it go through. Then, when it comes time to ship your items, they look and say OMG, it's a PO Box, we don't ship to them! So they look up the last address they have for you, and FedEx it to that. In my case, my PO Box is in southern California, and the last address they have for me is in Oregon. So they sent it a thousand miles away.",PissedConsumer_Global
"I kept and built a defective cabinet which I could have exchanged because I was told I would receive a $50 digital IKEA gift card as compensation. Required a ton of extra effort on my part and turned out OK but not nearly as nice as it was supposed to be. And then, no gift card in spite of 3 follow-up calls from me. (Emails are totally ignored.) More promises made but none of those happened either. AND, to make it all a lot worse, the only reviews you can give are about the agent, not about receiving any actual help. The whole situation TOTALLY sucks.",PissedConsumer_Global
"Updated by user Feb 21, 2025 Company fixed the issue and I have been provided with apology. I kept calling and emailing the company. Original review Jan 21, 2025 This entire situation has gone beyond ridiculous. I trusted IKEA to accommodate the order and complete the transaction of my new kitchen. I met three times with store personnel, and confirmed with an online planner that my order could be delivered, would be delivered, and that if I used the delivery service, ALL items on my list would be available. I then paid the amount on the invoice with that trust in place. I have made about 7 phone calls to IKEA, and have spoken with multiple people who are unable to assist in any way. This is so absurd that it deserves a full-scale evaluation and case study by anyone at IKEA who may be remotely interested in figuring out how to really mess up a customer order.  I still do not have but two small boxes delivered by FedEx a day late. What is going on? And why can IKEA not assist? No one can. Every single phone call is met with the same set of confusion.  BACKGROUND  The order has been delayed for over 3 weeks. I have made multiple calls. I have paid $10,000+ for a complete kitchen that was supposed to have been delivered on December 30, 2024. Each call to a customer service representative results in two different stories. 1. The items are not all available. 2. The delivery company is delayed. The delivery company has attempted to deliver one time on a date that was not scheduled. I was not home. This has ceased to be appropriate, or truthful, or even sane. What is going on? Why can't IKEA be honest? Manage this order? Report the situation accurately? Locate my order? Get the $10,000 in materials to my location? Redirect the order? Allow me to pick it up? Solve this situation? I have a completely gutted kitchen ready for the cabinetry and all associated parts. IKEA has no idea what's going on.  Can anyone assist? Or am I intentionally being delayed, dealt untruths, or simply caught up in an organization that has no real people in it?",PissedConsumer_Global

"Original review updated Jun 17, 2024 My wife and I recently ordered a couch and throw pillows from Ikea, and unfortunately, our experience was far from satisfactory. Let me break down the issues we encountered: Delayed Delivery and Extra Charges: We paid an additional $150 for scheduled delivery, with the promise of receiving our items within three days. However, the reality was quite different. After we paid, it took us well over a week to get a scheduled delivery.",PissedConsumer_Global
"First off, they reply in Estonian, even when requesting someone that speaks English. Id love to speak the language, but I just dont. When the delivery person did not respond when I called at a missed delivery (because he did not park at the correct apartment building..and then walked over to mine, quickly taking a photopart of the scam), I looked at my ikea.ee message and it said to contact them.

They said they would send us a new one then after three weeks I contacted him and was told That the order was canceled due to consumer related problem.

"Updated by user Oct 19, 2021 Yesterday I opened a case against Ikea with BBB again. Updated by user Oct 17, 2021 Hello, unfortunately the case is not solved. I opened a case with BBB. Ikea told BBB they would send me a gift card for $ 350, but I never received it.I think before closing the case, the BBB should have contacted me to make sure I received the gift card. This is not right! First I want to tell you a little about myself. From 1986 to 1991 I lived in Europe. When we arrived in Germany we bought 2 second-hand IKEA sofas. In 1989 we moved to Poland and took the sofas that were still in perfect condition.  At the end of 1991 we were moving again to Uruguay.  And since the sofas were still impeccable, I decided to reupholster them. I am a loyal IKEA customer and when I needed a new sofa of course it had to be from IKEA. The sofa is very comfortable but unfortunately the upholstery is falling apart, it is literally falling apart! Every time I sit down I end up with pieces of the couch all over my clothes. And the cushions are falling apart as well. After going through cancer and a stroke I can't resist this anymore. The truth is I am very disappointed and I would like IKEA to give me a solution. I called IKEA Usa many times, from the end of February until today. Also, on March 5th I sent photos. Today, March 26 they told me that my Sofa is not under warranty because the Article Number is not the same that the FRIHETEN sofa has today!!! This is ridiculous and unacceptable because Ikea has a 10 years warranty.

Ikea is the most frustrating organization to try and order cabinets from on-line. They will only allow you to order the parts that are currently in stock - there is no back-ordering capability. So if you have 100 pieces in your order and 25 are not available you can only order the 75 that are. And then you have to keep going back on-line and checking to see when the other parts are available. Wouldn't it make more sense to let me order the full order and then deliver or let me pick up what is available now and then allow me to get the rest when it is back in stock?? Wouldn't supply chain want to know what products customers actually want rather than guess??,PissedConsumer_Global

"Entered Ikea wearing a mask, with my younger child in tow, also wearing a mask, even though we have medical/behavioral exemption issues... (Per Gov. Wolf).But, not wanting to ""wreck"" others experience, or be mask shamed by other customers as has happened before, we complied. Met a really nice rep in the couch section, really sweet and helpful. Asked to speak to her Supervisor, and gave him a glowing review of her. She knew how hard times are with masks, sweating, etc.. and was really pleasant. Anyway, went then to mattress section, laid my purse down to write something on paper, and was promptly yelled at by two older employees, because my mask had slipped below my nose. I wear glasses, and so they fog up.. No excuse, but needed to see.. So from time to time, the mask has to be below, in order to unfog.. Right? Anyway, I was told, ""you need to put your mask over your nose,"" and I said, ""I cannot breathe, just give me a minute."" I told him I don't even need to wear one, but am doing so as a curtesy. So instead of letting it go, he does this. He gets on his phone, and loudly says into the phone, ""we have a non-mask wearer here, we have a non-mask wearer here."" Like I was in Nazi Germany or something!!! And the other employee is hollering, ""Masks save lives, masks save lives."" So both my son and I stop shopping and leave to check out as fast as we can. So here is the other *** and *** thing.. We get in line, and then the line ""monitor whispers something to the clerk, who turns around and stares at me, and then he tells another clerk something, and she turns around and stares at me too. So I get in line with the clerk who was staring at me, since there were only two lines open, and she does not say ONE SINGLE WORD TO ME the entire time. Not hello, nothing. So different from the gal in couch section. So, I check out, and THEN over the loud speakers, this women says, ""To our customers at IKEA under Gov Wolf orders you must wear a mask in the store, and it must cover your mouth and nose at all times You must wear a mask. Thank you."" Do you think that was meant for me, or just a coincidence? There are THREE exceptions to that order; Mental, Behavioral and medical... I have never been treated so *** in my whole life.. I/we did wear a mask, although I/we have the exemption... and was treated like a criminal just because I had to pull it down for a minute. You gotta be kidding me. I will never ever shop at IKEA again. You have lost a customer because you are treating them as if they are a leper... shame on you.

Upon calling IKEA and attempting to navigate the phone tree, an automated message states that call volumes are higher than normal and then the call is terminated. That's it.

"A little background. I have been an Ikea enthusiast since the age of 5 when my parents first took my brother and I to the store. One of my earliest memories is the children's section of Ikea because the stuffed animals and room stuff was all cheap enough that my parents would actually let us pick things out! I also loved the french fries in the cafeteria, still do! Flash forward to now, I am 30 years old, still a diehard Ikea gal. I tried to place an order on 4/6/2020, completely understanding that COVID-19 is causing several companies to have a lag time in their customer service department and an increase in order delays. But who isn't trying to redecorate/DIY their way through the quarantine?",PissedConsumer_Global

Tamirra insists that it will magically arrive tomorrow, 10/20, even though it has not yet been picked up by FedEx (I do have a tracking number now, but FedEx does not have my items) while Thomas now says 10/25 and claims they were out of stock. Remember, Thomas is the wonderful CSR who informed me 5 days ago that FedEx was already in possession of my shipment! 1) I customize two ALGOT builds on IKEA USA website. 2) I finalize and purchase them on 10/4/2017 3) I receive the order in two separate deliveries, in four total boxes.  The last delivery arrived 10/11 4) I unpack boxes to inventory parts and prepare for install. 5) I discover I am missing crucial parts. 6) I call to have them replaced and I am told that it will take 14 days for these items to ship. 7) The next morning, I call to request this be expedited because I have nowhere to store all of these ALGOT parts while I wait, and because this was IKEA’s error not mine.  The items are the uprights to hang the whole unit. If I was missing ANYTHING else, I could have got these parts off my floor. 8) I am told that this is impossible. I am told I will receive a $30 gift card and refund of my original shipping charges (a bit over $30).  9) That sounds like BS, so I continue to request my order to be expedited. IKEA made the error, it is IKEA's responsibility to make me (the customer) whole in a timely manner. Not to further inconvenience them. 10) 10/13 I am told by ""Thomas"" via email that not only is it not possible for IKEA to ship overnight (lie) it is a moot point because FedEx already has the replacement order, it is on its way to me and it is scheduled to be delivered on 10/20 11) I continue to call and email to request a tracking number as I see nothing incoming on my FedEx dashboard and phone calls to FedEx tell me nothing has been shipped to my address, nor do they even have a record of a label created to my address.  12) I receive no answers, no refund and no gift card. I get no tracking number. I DO receive an email with an invoice stating I need to pay $10 by 10/22 in order for my replacement items to even ship to me. (what???) 13) I open a BBB claim.  I prepare the email chain and screenshots of all communications from email, Facebook and Twitter, my original invoice and the new one to send to BBB if needed. 14) I call the bank to speak to someone regarding my options. They also have NO record of a pending refund. 15) 10/19, I finally receive a response to my inquiry about this tracking number for the delivery ""Thomas"" told me was scheduled for 10/20.  ""Richard"" tells me, despite the long email chain attached to his response with all of these details, including ""Thomas""’s claim it was scheduled for 10/20, the Case ID and my new order number that my order was already delivered on 10/11 and that if I am missing something, he can submit a replacement for me. (This is getting ridiculous). 16) I call 10/19 and I am told enthusiastically that my replacement order is now packed and scheduled to be picked up by FedEx. Wait, what?  According to ""Thomas"", FedEx has had my items for at LEAST 5 days already! I have already been unhappy with the level of customer service I have received, now I am outright angry. I ask for a manager. 17) I am placed on hold for a ridiculous amount of time in which I am able to make a whole new phone call to my bank.  As an update, there is still no pending refund. 18) I finally get a manager who, after I explain the situation basically says “Hm”. and “I’m sorry” and basically nobody is going to do one single thing differently here to resolve my issue. I am at this point, way beyond angry and I hang up.  I am done speaking to incompetent people who are unable to do anything but hem and haw and go in circles with paying customers. 19) Nothing is resolved. This is a whole new level of incompetence and I am honestly flabbergasted that IKEA finds this an acceptable way to resolve issues that their company causes your customers.  One of the prices you pay in running a business is eating some of your profits when you mess up. I certainly never hemmed and hawed and refused to expedite things that were the result of my company’s errors or told a paying customer “sorry I messed up, but I’m just going to resolve this as slowly as possible, lie and run you in circles before making you whole”",PissedConsumer_Global

"You cannot reach the store where you purchase items - they make you call a toll free number where you hear 88 minutes, 49 minutes, 180 minutes and the recording you're forced to listen to plays over and over dozens of times. The 49 minutes today was actually 109 mins - only to find out they cannot help you with a delivery issue - they must fill out a form and have the delivery department call you back in 90-120 minutes. That was a big fat lie! That was 9 hours ago and I have not received the call-back and have no doubt I will never get a call back from anybody. I finally called the local store and guessed at various extensions to get an administrative person, who was nice enough to transfer me to someone who looked up my order.

After spending 35 hours on the phone over 14 phone calls, and being promised the check for all my furniture that was recalled, after 5 months of harassment and constantly being lied to, I'm asking other customers in a similar boat to reach out - let's punish IKEA together.

"Updated by user Nov 16, 2017 Nov 17, IKEA is still holding my money hostage. IKEA = CROOKS = THIEVES = TOTAL INCOMPETENCE Updated by user Nov 15, 2017 Nov 15, IKEA is still holding my money hostage. This is incompetence in it's highest form. IKEA SUCKS! They are thieves. Updated by user Nov 14, 2017 On Oct 8, I placed an order with IKEA online for an 8 drawer dresser and a 6 drawer chest. I needed it shipped because I recently had surgery and am unable to lift heavy objects.  I work weekdays so needed a weekend delivery and the earliest Saturday delivery I could get was Oct 21, so I set it up. They sent me emails, Order Shipped, Ready to Deliver. I was supposed to get a phone call with the time frame of delivery 4 hr window or 12 hr window but it never happened. Saturday came and I waited and waited and then got an ""Your IKEA order was not delivered as scheduled"" email.  It tells you to contact Customer Support but doesn't give you a phone number, just a link that takes you to IKEA customer support page that gives you their hours and FAQs. Not really helpful. I search and find a way to send them an email asking why they didn't deliver my items. Within an hr I get a call from the delivery guy saying that one item was damaged and it was IKEA's policy not to delivery damaged items.  He gave me two options, deliver both items and I could take back the damaged one for replacement myself - gee, why would I do something stupid like pay for shipping if I was willing and able to do that? Or have them send a replacement and set up a new shipping date. Well I didn't really have much of a choice and I wasn't going to pay for damaged goods, so I chose the latter option. Then I got an email on Oct 23 with the IKEA customer service number, finally a way to speak to a 'human'.  877-686-**** it included a pdf with information on the replacement. On Oct 31, I finally get notice that my item has Shipped, on Nov 1, my order was ready to deliver and on Nov 3 I got a call with a delivery window of Saturday Nov 4 between 10am to 2pm. Another Saturday I sit waiting, making sure I have space for the boxes, area for assembly and I realize it's after 1pm, I get a phone call from the delivery guy, he's running late, he should be here by 2:30. What could I say, ok, whatever.  Promptly at 2pm, I get an email from IKEA stating that my items were delivered. Hmmm, No, No they hadn't. So I responded to their 'no-reply' email anyways stating that I hadn't received anything yet. Now, it's 3:30 and still no delivery, I call the delivery guy back and he says he's 7 minutes away.  He brings in three boxes, I said that my order was for 2 items, a dresser and a chest. All he had was one - so I told him that I wouldn't sign for it since it was not a complete order. They packed it back up and took it away. When they leave I call IKEA customer service and speak to Ashley, I had to put pressure to get them to refund both the order and the shipping costs, but finally after speaking to her manager, it was approved.  Note that I'm taking this from her words, I asked for an email stating that everything was going to be refunded but as of Nov 8, I still have not received that email. Nov 7, I check my bank account and still no refund. It is one day shy of a month of this IKEA incompetence and I still have nothing, no refund for an order that wasn't delivered complete. I called IKEA customer service again, demanding that my refund happen NOW.  The initial rep said that there was a 20 minute wait to speak to a manager - their tactics seem to be, annoy the person enough so that they give up - I told her, I've waited just about a month so far and gotten nothing, 20 minutes doesn't matter, so she put me on hold. I was put on hold for a total of 40 minutes of just shy a one hour phone call.  More great IKEA customer service. Then a customer service resolution specialist got online, I explained the whole situation once again to him, he put me on hold and came back saying he'd do his best to have my refund processed the next day.",PissedConsumer_Global

Despite -- on both days IKEA assuring me they would. So now we're scheduling truck visit #5. Each visit requires me to take a day off work. Meanwhile the delivery company phone disconnects you automatically when you press zero for operator. Meanwhile, I have to wait on hold for almost an hour while IKEA calls the delivery company, because they don't have the technological ability to just call me back. Really.",PissedConsumer_Global
"First, this is not a judgement on the IKEA business model or the quality if IKEA products. Second, I once bought thousands and thousands of dollars of IKEA products in Portland and transported them 5 hours away to Southern Oregon in my pickup truck and trailer. Word spread quickly, so I was asked to make the trip every six weeks or so for about a year and a half. I would often assemble items for friends and neighbors, so I'm very familiar with IKEA. Their product is popular and that Portland store was very well managed. My experience at the store in Centennial has been quite different.",PissedConsumer_Global
Ordered a sofa bed in store. No room left in my truck after other smaller items on board so I paid $199 for shipping. Big mistake! Delivery cancelled on day of twice. First time XPO Logistics said they went to the store and the item was not available for pickup. A week later they said that there was no room left on their truck to fit our sofa. A week later it finally delivered but I had to bust my but to get it assembled for holiday guests arriving. XPO said it was IKEA's fault and that I should get the shipping charge refunded. Attempted to call Customer Service four times and gave up in frustration after 40 minutes on hold (they don't even have the guts to tell you how long you should expect to wait!) So I sent an e-mail.,PissedConsumer_Global
I ordered $1300.00 worth of furniture and after trying three times to get it delivered after the delivery company said they were bringing it and didn’t (didn’t even have it on their truck!) I cancelled the order. Even that took two calls to ikea to get done after waiting on hold for 25 minutes each time then another 10 minutes both times while they were doing something with the order. After a week I hadn’t received my refund and called AGAIN. They said they were confused on their end but would get the refund out within 24 hours.,PissedConsumer_Global

There is no option on-line to cancel. The only way is to call their 888 phone line and go insane while you listen to their recorded sales pitch and earthy crunchy PSA's on loop for hours (kill me now!). I literally spent hours on hold this morning. When someone (usually very rude) did answer, the response I got was ""we are having unusually high call volume today, and you are in the wrong dept anyway so I can't help you. Let me get you over to the right dept."" Then more ""save the earth"" PSA's while on perma-hold for another hour only to be told the same thing yet AGAIN. Gaaaaah!",PissedConsumer_Global
"Spent over $1000 on cabinets and inserts. Boxes were missing pieces and the installers said I would have to go back to the store (and wait over an hour in returns/exchanges?) to pick up the pieces. Then I would have to reschedule the installers to come back out and fix. The installers acted like this was business as usual and were in a race to get out and on to the next unfinished job. I called customer service and asked for a refund on the labor and they said they can submit a request. I'm sure the representative did not submit the request (on the phone for over 30 minutes waiting for a representative, now waiting over 15 for a manger).",PissedConsumer_Global

The Falster outdoor set is GOD AWFUL. Did anyone test this set before deciding to sell it in stores? It does not come clean. We are talking NOTHING will clean it.

Third time in the Brooklyn store in one week. Only to arrive to find out the piece I need is out of stock. Already spent over 1K and really disappointed that the reps can't guarantee any stock even if we call ahead of time. It's not easy getting around in NYC! They also won't waive the delivery fee. I've been waiting in the store for a sales rep that the store manager sent. Nowhere to be seen. I would say IKEA is the Spirit Airlines of furniture stores.

This time, we ordered some bedroom furniture from Ikea for a surprise birthday for our daughter's bedroom. I had scheduled next day delivery and as promised it was scheduled but never delivered. The driver claimed that they there at the scheduled time, but left even I got there. I spoke to company representative after being on hold for a good amount time only to be given a case number (which Ikea claimed was just a courtesy to us after taking the money). I was notified that a representative would call me within 24-48 hours. Lo and behold no one called and I finally got tired of waiting and called them. This time the wait was even longer over 95 minutes. Fortunately I had dishes to do - so I left my phone on speaker and just hung on until I spoke to a live person.",PissedConsumer_Global

After two weeks of back and forth and not getting any help, we bought a bed somewhere else and called to cancel our IKEA order. We were told FedEx would be coming to take the boxes back and a refund would be issued. After another week, nobody showed up to get the boxes and we have not received a refund. We called the customer service AGAIN and were told the previous customer service rep did not process a refund, did not even cancel our order, and did not schedule a driver to pick up the boxes. We scheduled a pickup at the time and were assured a refund would be given. It is now December 23rd and the delivery drivers (who were NOT FedEx, btw) just now picked up the boxes from my house.

"In 2014 I spent almost $5000 on a new Ikea kitchen. Major selling points were my previously positive Ikea experiences, the offered warranty, and the fact that I would be able to switch cabinet doors at a later point if I wanted a different look. I was going with white gloss on the top and black at the bottom, a look that will be very 2014 in a couple of years. For the bottom cabinets I used the dark Gnosjo doors, since they were the only dark slab doors available. I realized at the time that these doors were being sold at bottom prices, but I had faith in Ikea and its advertised 25 year warranty, and in the back of my head I was already picking new doors anyway, since the Gnosjo show every fingerprint and water drop. I was so sold on this concept and the general idea of renewability and corporate accountability, I pitched Ikea’s greatness to every- and anybody whenever the opportunity arose no matter if they wanted to hear it or not.",PissedConsumer_Global

After all of the waiting, I was told ""sorry, you need to come back to the store for us to credit you the coupon"" Like I said, over an hour drive, over $300.00 spent, over 1 hour on the phone and that is how I am treated over a $20.00 coupon.

"OK, here’s my ongoing nightmare with the IKEA in East Palo Alto, California. I paid $2K for a bed, sofa, desk, and mattress to be delivered. They were supposed to deliver and assemble it on Saturday August 29th. They gave me a “4 hour” window from 9am – 1pm. Of course, they didn’t show up so I called the store. No one can tell me the status. They put the onus on me to call the delivery company, Dynamex. Dynamex can’t give me the status and they can’t reach the driver on the phone. Finally, I get a call from the Dynamex driver at 3pm and he says he thinks he can come by in a “couple of hours”. At 7pm, the driver calls me and says he can come by now. I tell him that I paid for it to be assembled it too. Then he says that he’s not going to deliver the furniture because he doesn’t have time to assemble it. I wasted my entire Saturday waiting for IKEA to show up and provide the merchandise and services that I paid for.",PissedConsumer_Global

When we went to get it delivered, and possibly assembled, the man behind the counter gave me a quote based on my total bill, not the item itself, which is incorrect based on their own rules.

When I got home and glanced at my receipt, I realized that I had been misinformed by the IKEA rep and that the charge should have been $89. That may not sound like a big difference, but it's the difference between reasonable and gouging in my opinion. I tried to get the change made via phone, but got caught on IKEA's typical customer service hamster wheel and after about an hour on the phone was told the change could only be made in-store.",PissedConsumer_Global

"Do yourself a favor.. DONT EVER PURCHASE FROM IKEA. Unless you are in for blood boiling headaches for months. We ordered a whole kitchen from them. Mistake #1. Everyone at Ikea is pretty much incompetent and have no idea what is going on. Everyone we talked to asking the same question gave different (and wrong) answers. This order was placed online and took over 2 months to deliver, and many horrible phone calls in between. It takes an average 1-2 hours on the phone with Ikea, where 90% of the time you are on hold, and then when you get to a human, you are switched to another department, thus waiting another 45 minutes on hold. They give you no information or updates to your order. So when you are trying to plan for a re-model of a house, you can't plan anything because Ikea will give you completely wrong information or no information at all... ie: when you order will be delivered, what is the status, what is in stock. They re-booked our order, changed our order number, delivery date, everything, without notifying us (took another 2 hours on the phone to figure this out). When the order was finally received (in 3 separate shipments and 3 separate absurd delivery charges, when we requested only 1 shipment), obviously things were missing from the order...

No notification of installation date. If we had not called to see where they were, no one would have contacted us that the time had been delayed by a week. Then they damaged the product, and left a rookie installer alone, so it took longer than scheduled. In fact it is still not completed.

"I went with my daughter to help her choose a sofa. She found one within 15 minutes. It took a few hours to actually purchase it! The employee didn't know the computer system, his colleague didn't want to help him and kept wandering off. He brought us to a different department, we followed. The price rang up high because the first guy who only works weekends forgot to include our family and friends card so we didn't get the sale price. We waited and waited for someone to void the sale. We were talked into just going to another register to get a refund for the difference. I just got a gift card in the mail for that refund when I assumed it would show up as a credit on my daughter's credit card.

I'm calling bs on this- every other store processes returns to the original form of payment without needing a physical card, and I'm sure Ikea can process online returns without a physical card swipe. This restriction serves no purpose but to avoid allowing returns.

Put on hold bY the computer for another 15 minutes. Went back into the store and asked for the manager. She came eventually...with an attitude.,PissedConsumer_Global
"I have bought a dresser in Ikea on July 2nd. It came damaged. Asked for a replacement that also came damaged.

"I purchased a China and special ordered doors for it ,hand picked flowers at The Bayamon Location selecting colors and asking sales associate to note observations on my request,It is well known IKEA delivering at a 100 percent is impossible.with that said Delivery was made 3 days after purchase ,and without correct flower selection.Furniture was delivered without assembly instructions enclosed,is this a mere tactic to force clients to hire their assembly service? Though I called numerous times prior to delivery to make sure I was getting the doors I had ordered ,- and IKEA personnel assured me I would I waited delivery ,noticed doors not in boxes called 11 times to report it ,I did not get doors by the time of assembly which was a whole week later than my purchase date ,mind you that it was cancelled impromptu and change on the day and time of assembly 3 times .i have now a china with no doors and as per customer service one of the managers refuses to own up to it and send doors which I paid for deliver it service I paid for and far less assemble it .I will have to take this further to have it resolved I will never shop at IKEA again .I am appalled at their awful planning of logistic and such mediocre execution and a far poorer customer service training at the Bayamon Puerto Rico Location .",PissedConsumer_Global

I know this happens, but the fact they knew months, if not years in advance of the line ending, and failed to warn customers that extra slipcovers would no longer be offered, makes me crazy. In my case, it was about three months. I would have bought two or three instead of waiting to change my room look. It’s not like they didn’t have my address or email.

After spending 30 minutes trying to locate the boxes to assemble we found out they were out. We settled for another unit but want glass doors. My wife found one she liked. We asked an attendant and he checked for us. He said the door was dropped and would never get anymore. Why is it on display? Another 30 minutes.

Ugh -- I have the place rented for July, so now we will have to scramble, but will make it work. Long story short -it didn't arrive June 20th as IKEA's delivery partner, Urban Express, is a total rip-off, f-up co. Text indicating a delivery widow were apparently sent in error as the items never found their way to the truck that day. Four hours lost from work and contractor is now indicating that July 1st completion date is going to be difficult. Same thing happens June 21st. Lots of screaming, teeth-gnashing and apologies ensue and I am PROMISED that the items will arrive on the 22nd (Sun) only after I tell them that a later date is unacceptable and that I already have paid a contractor for two days that he's done nothing.

First, the delivery date was three weeks out for fairly popular and always in-stock items. Second, the driver did not follow my delivery instructions. Third, he refused to attempt a drop off 10 minutes after his first failed attempt. Fourth, I got a 35 minute wait to get a customer service representative on the phone. Fifth, he wasn't able to resolve the issue and punted me off to another team. As of now, I do not have my shipment and have no idea when and how this will get resolved.",PissedConsumer_Global

"This place is disgusting just because the Manager by the name of Jasmine has no customer relations instruction, laughs at a disable customer and does not even apologize for the cashiers actions, who for the record she declined to give her name to me when I wanted to file a complain and this ""manager"" Jasmine declined to give me her name as well. Everything started when my Mother is online and she is putting our shopping on the table so the cashier could scanned, the cashier never greeted us and she had a nasty attitude an earlier customer left a set of lamps that he did not wanted and this unprofessional and nasty cashier instead of asking my Mother, who is disabled, if that item belonged to her she started screaming and her and being nasty and did not listen to my Mother trying to explain that the lights did not belong to us, then I arrived with a frame so I ask her the price and she get enrage, sorry is not my fault that there was nobody on the frame dept and on top of that the place was filthy and most of the items upside down and was unable to check the price and in a rush to get back in the line, then i hand her my Ikea Family card and she gave me a lecture that the card has to be handed and when and why and....oh God why this ""professional cashier"" did not ask the card at the very beginning when technically she has to, of course she didn't because she was too mad to even greet us, also im semi-paralyzed and it took me a little bit for me to take out my keys and i try to explain this to her and she stated ""I DON NOT CARE YOU SHOULD GIVE ME THIS AT THE BEGINNING"" so i ask to see the sign that states that and she tells me enough and give me this and softly states a racist remark towards my health situation and my accent and i scream at her and demanded to see the manager that i was not going to tolerate to be insulted by her and i wanted to see the manager, her coworker a big guy with glasses calls the Police Officer but he never did anything to stop her coworker from insulting and being racist to my mother and I, when the Officer arrives he ask what is going on to us and I have to tell you he was a very nice and caring Police Officer, I know that many people sometimes is not lucky, but this officer was caring and had compassion for our situation and he even try to explain to the ""manager "" Jasmine but this manager did not care, im not sure why she was so racist, she declined to listen to us, stating ""THE CASHIER TOLD ME ENOUGH, DO YOU HAVE MONEY COME HERE TO THIS OTHER CASHIER AND PAY"" and I was in shock so the officer ask her to be nicer and she did not even listen to him, at this point my Mother starts crying for all this discrimination and injustice so we told this so called ""manager"" (who should read a dictionary to understand what customer service stands for, because her lack of this service makes her not to be the proper person to treat customers AT ALL), to keep this stuff, the officer kept being so nice and told us to buy it since we did the line and we wanted the items and i explain that even do i need them i was not going to enjoy any of them since we were discriminated and nastly treated, the cashier treated people from her race cordially and with an smile and because we are not from the same race she was from minute 1 rude and nasty, is not my fault that i do not look like her, but i treated as equals and she was still nasty and unprofessional, so sad that we left the store and my Mother was crying all the way home, this should not happened if the people working here should know how to deal with customers instead of treating people like if they are running a gang, they need to re-evaluate who they are and not being so ignorant and unpolite to their customers.",PissedConsumer_Global

"I got sucked into the ""oh my God, it's European, and it's here in the USA so we've all got to own an Ikea product, because if you don't you are a nobody"" frame of mind that has been going around. Ikea has inferior products bottomline. I purchased THREE Jannsjo (sp?) table lamps. Each one had a lifespan of between 1 to 4 months. That's it. Customer service when notified had a cavalier attitude on all three contacts and gave the impression that they just didn't give a ***. Three weeks ago I purchased an Antifoni floor lamp from an online seller. He told me it was an LED LAMP, as he checked the Ikea website, because their was NO indication on the box what bulbs it even used. I double checked the site and sure enough, LED. OK, so we are good to go and I purchased for $80. I received the lamp, set it up and...wait a minute.....thia is NOT LED. It turns out it's a freaking HALOGEN, which neither I or the Seller could ever have known from the lack of description on the box. And lack of consumer information on Ikea's website. I will not have halogen in the house because they are too risky, and would never have purchased had I known it was hallogen. It's not the sellers fault, and not my fault. When I contsctrd Ikea about this Ikea customer service told me that they are not responsible for third party seller information. HELLOOOO? The seller and I both got the information from the IKEA WEBSITE. Again cavalier Ikea attitude. The seller waz gracious in refunding my money while allowing me to continue looking for a LED bulb that might work. The one bulb that had potential did not work.

"I wanted to share my big disappointment with Ikea this evening. I relocated from CA to MA 2 weeks ago, and like every time I moved, I directly visited Ikea store to buy my furniture. As a frequent mover and having done this 4 times before, I think I can count myself a loyal Ikea customer. I would not even want to mention how I have advocated your products to my friends every time they complain about the quality. Last friday, I was excited to buy my furniture for my new apartment (bed frame, mattress, table, all necessary things not like a ceramic cup) and I scheduled delivery for Monday (today) between 6-10pm. Its a business day and all of us get busy with unexpected things; so that I called customer support to reschedule. However, they asked me to visit the store to reschedule since I was late to let them know. There was no way for me to visit them, because I had an unexpected scheduling problem (that was the reason I asked for help; how come I could make the store to reschedule?). Then while I was trying to set my problem up to be able to meet the delivery truck, truck driver called me to make sure I would still be there to meet them. I told them yes, because unfortunately I had no choice given from the support number. Before 5pm, truck driver called me again and asked me to be there at 6pm. I was trying to rush 6pm in a boston rush hour and I realized I was running 15 mins (yes 15 mins) late so that I texted the truck driver. The response was negative. While I was trying to jump between subway stations and get a cab, they told me they would not even wait 15 more mins in a 4 hr (6pm-10pm) delivery window. I gave up; gave up on the unbelievably unhelpful customer service and delivery team. I called customer service to speak with someone to share my disappointment and to reschedule the delivery. I waited 20 mins to talk to a delivery specialist and I waited 18 minutes to wait for speaking with the store manager who suddenly hang up before even I could say hi. Then I called again waited for another 15 mins and then gave up because nobody would answer.

"We ordered a bedroom furniture set including a bed, dresser, night stand and armoire. The delivery and installation team arrived outside of the delivery window reserved. The delivery team also forgot to load the mattress for the bed at the warehouse, so they needed to return to the warehouse to retrieve it and then return to our building. This caused us to have to re- reserve the freight elevator. While assembling our dresser, the delivery team tightened down one of the screws too tight, causing a crack on the top panel of the dresser. The delivery team explained that we could either reject the piece and they would dismantle it and return it to the warehouse, which would require a claim process, or we could negotiate a discount with Ikea. We needed a dresser and could live with the crack, so we decided to pursue a discount. three weeks and several phone calls later, Ikea has informed us that they do not offer discounts. We asked why then the delivery team told us that we could pursue a discount? They responded by telling us that some stores do offer discounts on furniture damaged during assembly, but this particular location does not. We asked why these delivery people told us that since they clearly work for this particular store, and they could not provide an answer. They just kept telling us that we should have declined the piece.

At 5:05 I call ""3PD,"" their delivery outfit, and they said, ""...oh he's just finishing up, be there soon..."" 30 minutes go by, call again; this goes on another 3 times, each time we seem to move backwards in the que. When they get there, the ""3PD"" guys tell me they were to load at 7 am that day, but because of Ikea's fumbling they finally load at 11. Ikea needs to have a plan for this, to call scheduled customers and arrange for a new time so customers don't have to wait around in the dark. I called Ikea a few times in this whole caper, and they were not only no help they were arrogant; when I was about to cancel the whole thing, the Ikea rep offers, ""...well, they may give you your delivery charge back..."" But the implication was that if I cancel the whole thing I would be stuck with the delivery charge.",PissedConsumer_Global
We recently bought an IKEA area rug for the bedroom. Within a day the whole house began to stink. When I came home that night I immediately removed the rug from the house and opened all of the windows to try to clear the air. I went to bed with a headache. It has now been a week - the rug is outside in the sun - and is still failing the sniff test on a daily basis. What is causing the rug to smell so bad? I tried to contact IKEA to no avail.

"I paid for a delivery of new kitchen cabinets to arrive on 7/20/13 from 3-7pm. I waited for the delivery, but the driver did not ring the bell. My phone was out of service however, so I did find that he called when it was back in working order. I called to reschedule the delivery on the following Monday, it we agreed that I would not be charged the reschedule fee, and it was for 7/27/13 from 10-2pm. This time my phone was working fine, but they didn't show up.",PissedConsumer_Global
"We stopped for food in the cafeteria. Pulled out a 20. When I got back change for a 10 I corrected the cashier, who had stuffed the bill into the drawer before making change. She continued to check people out and make change, instead of immediately calling a manager. Waited for a LONG time. Surprise, when they counted the draw it was correct. This was not a situation where I could have been mistaken, or I would have walked awat. I also had two other people with me.",PissedConsumer_Global
"In August 2011 I made good on a promise to our teenage daughter to repaint and spruce up a room for she and her friends to “hang out” in the basement of our old house. When it was all done I agreed to trip to Ikea to get a futon, some chairs, a TV stand, etc. After the usual hours of assembly with Ikea things it all looked great, at least for a few months. One day she and her older brother mentioned to me that there was something wrong with the futon. On examination I discovered that the frame supporting the seat cushion had broken squarely in the middle (see photo) making it completely unusable as a couch.",PissedConsumer_Global
"Terrible! IKEA hold times are over 30 min to get help. This is the most unprofessional company I have ever dealt with... 3PD was supposed to deliver a couch for me from IKEA... Both IKEA and the customer service rep at 3PD said they would remove the boxes for me. However, when the delivery team arrived 20 min later, they refused. I called the same customer service lady back and she told me that’s too bad, she can't make them take the boxes. Therefore, I refused delivery and told them to take it all back because I won't deal with a company that lies to customers and refused to honor their promises... The delivery guys did not even have a copy of the receipt/ delivery paperwork for me... that told me I could ""take a picture of it with my phone.",PissedConsumer_Global
"Unethical behavior, I would never recommend buying from this company. The store had no 'local' number. The Delivery Manager promised me a refund the next day, kept my merchandise, and did not process my refund. I ended up speaking with a ""Sue' who said to me rudely ""well you shouldn't have left without your merchandise..."" that was her solution. HOrrible experience, plus they rip you off with the delivery ($99) and the assembly charges (from $250 to $650) whatever pennies you save you end up paying.

We went through a regular checkout line and purchased all pieces. When we arrived home in Nebraska we found out the clerk did not put all the pieces in our IKEA blue bag. The actual 'track' for the lighting was missing. I called IKEA at the 888 number on the receipt and was told there is nothing they can/will do. They admit they have the piece but will not ship it.

I then went to the customer service staff at the store and they told me that the same sofa might show up tomorrow (Monday). I enquired if I could put a hold on the piece they were going to get tomorrow but they told me that I COULD NOT put a hold on that the day before. Apparently I have to call the day I want to buy to make sure it is in the store before heading out and drive 16 miles to get to the store. According to the store I could not even put a hold on the day of when the item would be available again. Which If I am unlucky, could again be bought by someone else?

"My husband and I went to IKEA to look at kitchens because we were ready to remodel. When I say remodel, I'm talking moving walls and completely gutting a kitchen down to the studs. IkEA happened to have a 20% discount on all kitchen orders....made sense to me. We told the sales person we wanted the entire set up of kitchen and laundry room. She informed us that we had to set up an appt. with Signature Services Group who is IKEA's only kitchen design and installation group (sub-contractor). We set up an appt on 3/26 and informed them we wanted the same set up that was in the IKEA Covina store. He said that Signature Services Group does NOT include any other cabinets in the design, other than ""Kitchen"". He would not take any measurements and said we had to do it ourselves and order the cabinets, but his company could do the installation. We did as he instructed.

When it finally arrived around 5 pm, our delivery was not complete, I called to ask about it and was told that they did not ship it complete, gave me a case number, spoke to 4 different people in customer service, the first and second and third told me the missing items were in stock, the fourth in back line resolution, a Leshea, said they were not in stock and said she could not reach anybody in the store, even though I could, and then she finally said the items were not in stock, and that I would have to wait for 3 days until they could figure out where my items were. After 5 days, we call, and we are told that the items were not paid for, even though the 4 people I have spoken to before said they were paid for.

"Updated by user May 15, 2013 Ikea acknowledged that they were at fault. As compensation they gave me a $50 gift card PLUS they delivered six (6) Vardo under bed storage boxes AND four (4) pillowcases PLUS they promised to clean up their Better Business Bureau (BBB) ""F"" rating, AND to contact ALL nine (9) complainants that they had previously ignored. They also gave me the FAX number of the San Diego Ikea store manager and the direct line to the San Diego Customer Service Manager. I feel that they were sincere in their response and intentions, and that their settlement to me, having a cash value of about $250 was also fair. # 1 - I purchased a Nyvoll Queen Size bed, Sultan Flokenes Queen Size mattress, Queen Size sheet set, and Sultan Lade Queen Size slatted bed base (4 items) and paid for delivery and assembly, which included removal of my old mattress, box springs, bed frame, and headboard.  # 2 - Delivery was promised 2-6 p.m.  # 3 - Driver called at 8:30 a.m. waking me, and asked if they could make delivery immediately. I agreed for a 10 a.m. delivery.  # 4 - Driver arrived at 10 a.m., surveyed old bed, and said they could only remove mattress. I replied that the order called for removal of bed, box springs, and mattress, and if Ikea was unable to comply, I would have to cancel the order. Driver called his supervisor who told him to remove bed, box springs, and mattress.  # 5 - After old bed was removed, driver and helper delivered and installed new bed and then discovered discrepancy that bed was Full Size instead of Queen Size.  # 6 - Driver left Queen Size Mattress on top of smaller full size bed frame and told me to call Customer Service.  # 7 - Ikea Customer Service took the problem report and promised a call back ""soon"". When I didn't get a call back within 1-hour I called Ikea Customer Service again and was told this time that call backs take 24 to 72 hours even though I specified that this was a high priority, emergency situation, and that I needed to be able to sleep on the bed tonight, or be put up in a hotel until the situation was corrected.  # 8 - When I asked why Ikea would deliver a Queen Size mattress with a Full Size Bed on a set up and assembly order I was told (A) that Ikea does not question or verify their orders, and (B) ""Human Error"".  # 9 - I drove to Ikea San Diego. Customer Service told me to take a number and that there were 20 people ahead of me. I replied this was unacceptable and asked to speak to a supervisor. The Supervisor agreed that the mistake was their fault, and said that they would deliver the Queen Size Nyvoll bed that afternoon but could not set it up until 2 days later. I replied this was unacceptable and asked to speak to his supervisor.  10 - The new supervisor spoke to the delivery driver who agreed to deliver and set up the Queen Size Nyvoll bed that afternoon, and remove the full size bed. He was the same driver who had earlier delivered the wrong bed.  11 - Delivery, setup, and exchange was completed about 4:00 p.m. The driver asked me to put in a good word for him.  In my opinion, there is no excuse by Ikea for what happened. The order should have been scanned, checked, and double checked before it was originally sent out. That was not done. When the error was discovered, the driver should have contacted his supervisor, set up the exchange, and handled the details WITHOUT my having to take hours out of my own schedule. Instead there were MULTIPLE and CONTINUING problems. This is an example of how NOT to treat a customer.",PissedConsumer_Global

Bottom line Ikea is terrible. I bought a Galant filing cabinet which has a three lock dial. I followed the horrible picture directions on how to set the combination then locked it.

"A few weeks ago, I bought $4000 worth of furniture from IKEA (Woodbridge, VA) for my brand new home. I had IKEA pick, deliver, and assemble them for close to an additional $900. The delivery guys showed up on time and had a thick layer of mud on their boots which they spread on the new carpet in every room they stepped in. They delivered wrong items and assembled the right items (multiple of them) in the wrong way. One of the guys was flat out rude and disrespectful while the other was nice and polite. They both seemed inexperienced in everything but hauling furniture, and totally incapable of following written directions with diagrams that came with the furniture. We prepared a decent meal for each and invited them to eat, but the rude guy (team leader?) said they would eat it later; they did not eat it at all! They initially refused to haul away packages that were incomplete (since they had nothing to do with IKEA as delivery people hired by ANOTHER employer), but reluctantly did so when I made it clear to them that they could not use my son's bedroom as their storage. During their ""service"" time, the guys used multiple bathrooms in my house and left their filth everywhere which we had to clean up.",PissedConsumer_Global

Duplicate legs means screw holes are on the same side thus I am unable to build any of this.

I questioned this because I grabbed the last one off of the shelf but the girl on the phone reiterates ""we have more in back stock.""

"I had a very bad customer experience I had today with IKEA. I am a 49 year old professional who makes a living as a consultant in the area of customer service / experience and interaction center related service. My wife and I were excited to visit the Centennial, CO IKEA - our first visit since we live in the northern burbs of Denver and have been curious since it opened up. I am re-doing my office and thought I'd at least give it a shot to see what IKEA had for storage and some other office furniture.",PissedConsumer_Global
"We purchased a TWIN daybed for my college aged daughter's apartment in Philadelphia. We were told that it would cost $59 to deliver and $79 to assemble. Assembly alone would be $79 based on the price of the item. My carpenter husband decided to do it himself. The bed came in 3 packages numbered 1-3. We followed directions to the bin and took the numbered packages to the checkout along with a mattress, dresser, lamp and some bowls. We got to the apartment, unpacked the boxes, and the last one had the directions, we discovered the box was for the QUEEN bed. There was small print on the box (about a 12 point font) that did indicate this, but the person at checkout missed it, we missed it and it was in the bin we were directed to. I called the Philadelphia store and waited a half hour for assistance and was told that it was our fault we took the wrong box and when I asked if we could pay for assembly and have them simply switch the boxes, they told me, no, I would have to return them. I asked for a supervisor and waited another half hour for someone at a call center in Baltimore that told me the same thing.",PissedConsumer_Global

I had to wait at the service desk to get the $550 owed to me. After receiving a credit slip I kept checking my bank account and no credit. I called and they told me it takes 7-10 days to get my money back. They made the error and yet I had to wait for the reversal. I was short 2 boxes for the furniture and had to return to the store for additional boxes. Very little to no assistance in the store or for loading boxes. No instructions for assembly was included.,PissedConsumer_Global

The company who charges for the delivery and assembly told me that Ikea only arrange for delivery not for assembly, I need to call Ikea. So I called Ikea back then the nightmare began. My phone call either was tranfered to voicemail system or when they heared my voice, they just hung out, or the different people gave me different answer. I left my meassage in the voicemail box, but I never got any response. It took me more than 3 hours keep calling them, but I still didn't get any information. This is really very frustrated and drive me crazy. I asked my friend to help for calling them, and I was told that they said I didn't pay for the assembly.

"I patronized the Tampa, FL IKEA store to buy what amounted to an exclusive style of bed. For starters, the unbelievable size of the store (warehouse) was intimidating and totally customer unfriendly. It is perhaps the largest retail building I have ever seen devoted to a singular entity. In fact, when one enters an associate hands out a ""road map"" of the store interior. The concept is for the customer to make a selection, figure out where the item(s) are, and put them in one of their heavy-duty carts. Since I was looking for a particular furniture item, I was finally able to locate the item on the lower floor storage area. The color I wanted, I was then told, was in an area off-limits to the customers. This began a multiple series of waiting periods totaling over an hour.",PissedConsumer_Global

When the truck arrived late, only 3 items were delivered... apparently the 4th, a coffee table, wasn't even on the truck. My 19 year old signed the manifest at the driver's instruction for the 3 items, and then called customer service. After 90 minutes on hold, she gave up. I called the next day and got through within 30 minutes. The rep told me that if he entered a case regarding the missing item, it would take a ""very long time"" before the error would be resolved as they had a huge backlog. He said my best bet would be to go back to Ikea and just pick up the coffee table myself and then get it to my daughter.

I visited my local Ikea store in Atlanta to purchase drapery rods in brushed steel. I had purchased this product last year and was impressed with the quality. When I arrived at the store these were no longer available and the sales person stated this 'high quality' product had been discontinued. What was available were cheap plastic looking rods that were not a substitute. Ikea had been known as a company that provides good design at very reasonable prices. My impression is that the company is moving to cheapen their product line to increase their profit potential.

"I have been shopping at Ikea for abt 8 years now. truth be told, every time I assembled an ikea product I ended up not liking it for various reasons. But I never returned any product just 'cos I was too lazy to re-package and return (most of their furniture ends up becoming pretty bulky after assembly). But here's what happened recently-- I purchased 2 bar stools. After assembling them at home I found that they looked really cheap and unsturdy. They looked so bad that for a change I decided to fight my laziness and return the lousy stools . Being somewhat of a perfectionist I re-packaged them neatly (very neatly in fact). I expected no issues in returning this product. But to my utter disbelief this return turned out to be a shocker. The Ikea agent's first question itself kind of gave me a clue that this company does not know a thing about customer service. The agent asked me ""so sir, why are you returning this product?"". I have never been asked that question at any retail store in my last 10 years in USA. Anywayz, I told him the reason and he went on to open the package to see if all the content was inside and if there was any damage. fair enuff, I waited till he finished. To my utter shock he tells me ""sorry sir I cant take this back. You have assembled and unassembled this and we have a policy that we dont accept returns on assembled products. Plus there are a few scratches on the bar stool"". despite being shocked at that response, I tried to politely reason with him but he just insisted that it was store policy and he can do nuthing to help me. in shock and disappointment I just walked away promising myself that I will NEVER EVER return to an IKEA store again.",PissedConsumer_Global

Then I waited until 12th afternoon and called their customer service again. Then lady told me the thing that I order just came in and it will deliver on next Tuesday May 15. And until now I still not received anything yet. I called them again, they said the thing just came in today and hopefully will deliver today before 5 pm.",PissedConsumer_Global
"Updated by user May 06, 2012 Update: I contacted customer service and to my surprise they were very responsive. We rescheduled delivery and install of broken elements. Unfortunately Urban Express continued to miss delivery times and assembly. IKEA would make commitments and Urban Express would not meet them. The customer service agents were very effective at pushing Urban Express and ultimately the products were assembled to my satisfaction but it was extremely painful. I did get a credit for the delivery charges but would never do business there again.",PissedConsumer_Global
"Updated by user Dec 20, 2011 I had the misfortune of working for IKEA. Original review Dec 20, 2011 IKEA management created a hostile work environment when I advised managers of my interest in a different IKEA department.  IKEA management at the Colorado Centennial store are high school dropouts without any idea of running a business. The after-sales management caused such a screw-up that the home delivery division had to be shut down for 4 days. Of course all of the management that caused this fiasco kept their jobs. The good ol boy system is alive and well at IKEA.  IKEA treats their employees like trash and pays them as such.  The customer service is horrible and I had the opportunity to see it first hand. Once IKEA gets the customer's money they don't give a *** about them. The after-sales team in IKEA Centennial lead by Yvette M. Rumph is the worst run department I have ever seen. IKEA products have no quality that I can see. I put together all types of IKEA furniture and it was all ***.  I wish I had never applied for employment at IKEA and I know for sure I will never shop there.  Take a look at the website: IKEASUCKS.COM  Don't shop or work for IKEA, they are a poison to the American society.",PissedConsumer_Global

"The IKEA in Minnesota is doing a massive remodel, although when I had done my pre-shopping, as you do for an IKEA shopping expedition, there was no mention of an upcoming remodel. Same thing when I walked in the store - it was not until you were in the throes of the madness that is IKEA that you saw the mess. Most of the items I had preselected a few weeks earlier were not available anymore....the few employees that you can usually chase down were now a part of the remodel and truly it was customer helping customer. In my 55 years of shopping, it is the most poorly operated remodel of a store trying to remain open I have ever seen.",PissedConsumer_Global

I didn't hear anything until 9:15pm when the driver said they would be here in 45 min. at 10pmk, they called and said they would be here in 30 minute. At 10:45pm, they called and cancelled and said they would schedule for the following day. I told them I didn't think it was fair if they made me wait around for them for another 4 hours.

"I was thrilled when an IKEA opened recently in the Denver Metro area as I was beginning a kitchen overhaul. As a first step, On 3/12/12, I bought a small table and stools knowing that ""It is okay to change my mind"". I assembled the stools and realized that they were too tall for my kids to sit comfortably on. When I returned the stools with the original receipt on 3/15/12, I was told that I could not get a refund because I had assembled the stools. I was dumbstruck. Throughout the store the walls are plastered with the return policy in which writ large is a welcoming heart that says ""It's okay to change your mind"". Nowhere on the return policy written on the walls does the qualification about the product having to be unassembled. I asked the customer service rep to turn aroud and read aloud the policy posted DIRECTLY behind him and tell me where it says that items can no longer be returned when assembled. He agreed it did not say that; yet, he insisted that this is your policy. This lack of complete disclosure of your policy is deceptive at best. I would have never bought the items had I not been comforted (and reminded by never every wall in the store) by the idea that I could return my item for a refund.",PissedConsumer_Global

"Updated by user Nov 22, 2011 I received a call from a customer service manager at Ikea this morning and she apologized for my trails and tribulations. I really appreciated her professional but kind manner. She is arranging a replacement of my duvet. Further, she said she felt my case would serve as a good learning opportunity for the customer service staff and that they would be discussing it. She felt the item should have been returned without issue. I bought a duvet cover at Ikea Portland. I realized after a while that the snaps were mis-manufactured.  They just don't snap. It is a bit of a drive to the store so it took me a while to get back and I had no receipt. But since the issue was so small (a plain duvet cover, $50) and since I assumed Ikea would stand behind their product(and having never had any problem exchanging things w/o a receipt before) I wasn't worried about it. They examined the duvet and first told me that they couldn't take it back with a stain.  When I pressed them (what does a stain have to do with the faulty snaps?) they said they don't accept exchanges of linens w/o receipt. Long story short, I ended up speaking with four ""managers"" and wasting an hour waiting for them to find time to come out and speak with me. I wouldn't back down and accept that the world's biggest furniture store would actually want me to buy a mis-made product. Good customer service and confidence in quality is one of the main reasons I--and most of us--shop at ""reputable"" retailers like Ikea.  All fou ""managers"" were all surly, snarky, and curt. I was really surprised. I've had such a different sense of Ikea as a company! Now I have decided to never shop at Ikea again (and I've been a very loyal customer for over 10 years...I buy nearly all my household items there).  I am still pursuing the problem. This morning I got the same weird snarky, no-can-do mean-teenager attitude from the first person I spoke to at phone customer service. I asked to speak to HER manager (I was getting so tired of saying that!) and the guy was the first person who spoke like a professional (not mention an adult). He said he couldn't over-ride the store managers but he could give me corporate CS headquarters and wished me the best.  Now I await a return call from corporate HQ. So silly! I can't believe Ikea tolerates such poor management. Something is really wrong at the Portland store...my sense is that they have a store permeated by weak customer service culture.  But in the end I feel this is all for the best. Now I am more resolved to buy what I can from smaller, local stores.",PissedConsumer_Global

"Customers please beware of IKEA's cleverly written & deceptive return policy!! While browsing their store, you will notice an abundance of signs stating ""It's ok to change your mind"", and ""If you are not entirely satisfied with your purchase, simply return the unused item in its original packaging within 90 days"". Please know that if you remove any IKEA item from the original package what-so-ever, the item will be considered ""used"" & non-refundable. Case in point: We attempted to return a brand new coffee table. There was nothing wrong with this table; we just simply decided it wasn't quite what we wanted. I called the store to inquire whether or not I needed to disassemble the table & repackage it before returning it. I was told, ""We prefer you do not attempt to repackage the item to avoid damaging it, and we will need to inspect the item before refunding you"". This seemed legitimate & fair. After arriving at IKEA's returns/exchanges department, we were told ""Because this item was initially removed from the packaging, this item was considered 'used' & was non-refundable.""

It is a off/ creamy white. It didn't match our white furniture we already had. So took it apart, put it back in the box. The only different between now and 12hours previous is that the box was taped to keep it closed and the plastic bag that holds the hardware was ripped. We walked into customer service to find that we could only get store credit after maybe 16 hours of having purchased the shelves. Because the item is now used. They told us because it was already assembled and taken apart that when it had to be put together again it wouldn't be as sturdy as the first time it was put together so now they had to severely discount it. They don't care if their white isn't white. They told us we should have brought in a drawer from our existing furniture to make sure it matched and for that it was a preference problem and not a product default. But it is false advertising. They label it as white and as long ""as it is close enough"" then it is ok to label it white.

"Employees in IKEA raise up in the barns. They throw tempers on customers with hostile and hatred. Me and my mom were looking for help to get those heavy boxes from the shelf in the store of IKEA in Covina. Guess how the employee serve us? I have to say that their ability is just can press their fingers on the computer and chatting with other workers. Even a pig can do a better job than them. That employee called ""Franz"" working in the section of storage area. He threw the products that we need to buy so hardly and with temper on our shopping cart. There're glass shelf underneath it, and he just didn't care. If you did not like to serve us, why you still work in IKEA?",PissedConsumer_Global
"Purchased a vanity and sink. Assembled the vanity. It could not be centered under the mirror and light because the shelves to the left made it line up uncentered due to necessary the placement of the plumbing. I took the assembled piece along with the metal leg which had fallen off because my plumber said it was glued, and returned it assembled to IKEA Frisco, Texas. The clerk said he could not accept it because it was ""used."" He read the policy on my sale slip which is the same policy as on the web and on the wall by the return station. I stated that ""assembled"" wasn't ""used, but he pointed out that the hinges had been screwed into place and now that hole would never be the same - thus ""used.""

It was an hour before my number was called, and for much of that hour there was only one person processing returns, although there were numerous IKEA workers in the area and dozens of customers waiting. There was no evidence of a supervisor or manager. While waiting I tried to call the store phone number on the receipt, but was cut off 3 times, I was on hold for the 4th time when I finally got to the counter.

When the delivery company called to schedule the delivery I was told they don't even deliver on the date given on the web site. When I asked why they said ""deal with it"" or cancel.

"Back in 2005, my husband and I bought our first house. We live on the Kitsap Peninsula in Washington state, and decided to travel to the Ikea in Renton. We purchased several thousand $'s worth of products including: bed frames, dressers, night stands, a computer desk, a mattress, several kitchen items, and the worst of the worst an Ektorp sectional sofa. We liked the design of the sofa (the ""L"" shape fit our living room perfectly), as well as the fact that this sofa has removeable, washable covers. My husband and I believed this was perfect for our young family (at the time our son was 3 and our daughter was soon to be born). We now have 3 children ages 10, 6 and 4.",PissedConsumer_Global
"I was visiting (from South Africa) my daughter in Raleigh, N.C. a few weeks ago. We drove 3 hrs to Charlotte - excited about the Ikea shopping at 'THE END OF THE ROAD'. Being from Denmark I expected nothing less from Ikea than absolutely top friendly customer service - as it always is in Scandinavia. One of the items I bought was a Ruther swivel chair. At first I couldn't find it, when we wanted to check out, but a not so friendly sales assistant found it for me.",PissedConsumer_Global
"After choosing a chair and footstool at the Charlotte IKEA store my husband and I tried to pick it up, pay and leave. After spending over 1 hour locating, waiting for, and explaining what we needed to the ""customer service"" person in the pick up area, we learned that the footstool was out of stock and could not be paid for until it was in stock. Furthermore, we would be required to pay in advance for the chair, hope the footstool came into stock, then drive the 1 hour each way BACK to IKEA to pay (again, in advance) for the footstool if and when it ever showed up in stock. After calling for a few days the footstoll was back in stock, I drove all the way there to pay for it, and was told both pieces would be ready for pick up in 1 week or less -- they were supposedly in the SC facility. Well, here it is a month later and no chair, no ottoman, and every time I call IKEA for answers they have no idea and can not/will not provide any, much less realistic, delivery dates. I feel like I am stuck in the movie the MOney Pit ""It will be here in two weeks!",PissedConsumer_Global
"I purchased a bunk bed from IKEA. During assembly, I noticed that two parts were defective. The holes on these parts were not drilled all the way through, so it was an obvious manufacturing defect. I drove to the store for the second time. After waiting in line for more than half an hour, I was given two replacement parts. I went back and tried to finish the assembly, but I found out that the parts I were given were incorrect, the hole locations did not match. I drove back to the store for the third time and asked for replacement parts with the correct hole locations. The customer service person asked for my driver's license. When I asked why they need my license (looks like they wanted to scan the info) they said this is the ""policy for returns and exchanges"".",PissedConsumer_Global

The experience went along fine until I had paid for the merchandise and was ready to leave the store. I was asked by two different individuals to show my receipt. One was a store employee who, much to his credit, apologized profusely and looked genuinely remorseful after the look I gave him. The second was a rent-a-cop who was aggressive, confrontational, rude, and arrogant who insisted I comply with the receipt check in a very particular way (""I need to HOLD IT in MY HAND and LOOK AT THE MERCHANDISE."")

"I recently purchased 30 SLOM bottles w stoppers at the IKEA store in Elizabeth, NJ at a price of $3.99. The problem is that the online website advertised the price at $2.99; the website also mentioned that this item is not available online. When I got to the store, I expected to pay somewhere around the advertised price, not 33% higher per bottle. If I had known about the pricing, I would have shopped elsewhere but after investing the time to get to Elizabeth, I ended up forking over another $30 and I feel ripped off. While there is a subtle disclaimer at the bottom of the web page that states that ""pricing may be different"", 33% seems inordinately large. Not only did the cashier mention that these sorts of pricing problems occur frequently, but the pricing issue stalled the line of about 10 customers behind me, and then, the online IKEA chat-person (w whom I spoke earlier today) mentioned that the online presence is not affiliated with any of their stores.",PissedConsumer_Global

"love Ikea....if I wanted real quality that would cost me a pretty penny and last a lifetime, I would shop else where! Filled my place with tons of candles and pictures today. Are you people really complaing about a table that falls apart after you only pay 29.95 ....give me a break! Shopping @ Ikea is like going to Mcdonalds for dinner.

Do not purchase from Ikea unless you have a store in your area. Online and telephone assistance is a waste. They are quite useless and will simply wear you out with run-around and inability to perform. Very polite and apologetic. The company is simply not interested in retaining customers. The Nyland shoe cabinets have plastic compartments that are screwed in place behind each drawer/door. The plastic cracks and then you are simply out of luck.,PissedConsumer_Global

Not being satisfied with the outcome of both on 4/9/09 I wrote a detailed letter to Pernille Spiers-Lopez, IKEA's President (North America).

It was not available at any store in the US and they could not tell me when it would be available, anywhere. It seems this display was for effect only, they had no intention of providing this item, they only want to sell cheap furniture to young couples and college students. I have had the same experience with their office line, no stock and no arrival date. Their solution is to have me call back every so often to see if it was there, not likely.",PissedConsumer_Global

"I bought a two seater sofa (EKTORP) from IKEA, Toronto, Canada. The sofa turned out to be broken. The frame was slightly tilted to one side. I went to the store and asked if they can pick the sofa from my apartment. I told them that I'll pay for the transportation. The associate at the store filled out a work order with all information including my credit card info and told me that the store would not charge me for transportation and that some one will call me next day to arrange the pick up and once they get the sofa the full amount would be transferred to my credit card the same or the next day. However, no body called me and after several days I called the store to ask if they will send any one to pick the sofa. The associate on the phone told me that some one will call me with 7 days. This did not seem too convincing to me so I went to the store in person where this time they told me that I have to pay for transportation. I told them I had already offered to pay, but the associate said that I don't need to pay. Any how I paid the transportaion fee of $70 plus tax. The sofa was picked after two days. Once the sofa was returned, I did not get the refund. I called the store and the associate told me that it takes 48 hours for the refund. After more than 48 hours, I still did not get the refund. I called the store again and this time they told me that I have to go to the store in person to arrange for the refund. I told the associate I that already had provided all the info including the credit card info , but the associate said he can not help me over the phone.So I went to the store and asked for the refund. The associate went somewhere back in the store and returned after 45 minutes. The associate told me that the driver who picked the sofa did not enter it into the system when he returned to store so thats why the refund got delayed. This time however he said that I'll get the refund in 48 hours. Finaly when I got my refund it was $543.76 whereas I had paid $599 plus tax for it. Again I called the store where the associate said he can not help but can transfer me to resolutoins department. I kept holding for more than 30 minutes and no body answered, I called several times and the associates kept transfering me to resolution department, but no one answers from there. This is IKEA and their customer servervice!!!!. I had to fill the same form 3 times in store for a simple refund. When ever mentioned that I had already filled the form, the associate asked me ""where is it""?I don't know where to file a formal complaint against IKEA for my full refund.I will send a copy of this complaint to Better Business Bureau as well.

Finally, he came with the chair assembled and told me nothing wrong with it. It looks sturdy to him. And he won't issue the refund because it was assembled. But the item was opened for seeing but never installed or used. But it is ridiculous because he assembled it, of course, it is assembled and considered to be his definition ""Used"" and against the store return policy. So, I asked for customer service manager. There was a young girl came out and I recalled her name is Shiela, and she is the person in charge there which I doubted. And she said she could do us favor and grant me 70% of the original value store credit. I refuse because I won't shop again at this store.

I immediately called Ikea (on September 4th), spoke to a representative, and was told that someone would contact me in three to five days. My phone does not have voicemail and so an e-mail was sent to me on the 10th with contact times -- which were wrong. When I called on Friday September 12 at seven pm, as the e-mail said I could, customer service was closed. I called again last Monday, the 15th, and was put on hold for twenty minutes before speaking to a representative. She told me that I'd have to wait another thirty minutes before talking to someone else, and I wasn't able to do that because I was on my way to class. I asked if someone would be able to call on the Tuesday, and she said that wouldn't be a problem - but I didn't get a call until yesterday (September 20th) at noon, when I was in class.

This problem could be rectified easily by sending a tech with a power drill to my apartment, and that's what I expect to happen as soon as possible.

"IKEA will not refund any assembled furniture even though their return policy on the receipt stated that they would accept all refund.

After, bought it home and spend about 3 hours to assembled it, I found out it is too big for my kitchen. I went back to IKEA to pick a few small items and asked their customer service and sale associated on the sale floor about their return policy with assembled furniture.

On March 22nd, 2025, in order to facilitate the return, we proactively purchased appropriate wrapping materials and rented a U-Haul vehicle. Upon arrival at 1:05 PM, my husband was assisted by a representative named Cristina. Her initial attitude was aggressive, indifferent, and hostile. Despite acknowledging the excellent condition of our unit, she insisted that the bottom panels, which we had brought separately, be attached. My husband understood this requirement and was prepared to comply.",PissedConsumer_Global
"Our experience with Ikea has been so awful. First, they told us they had a rug in stock at their College Park store. By the time we got there, less than an hour later, they didn't have it. Then we ordered the rug and a rug pad online, and they arrived 3 days late. The rug pad was so thin and useless that we've been trying to return it. I paid for return shipping, and they told me to expect a delivery person between 9 am and 9 pm on July 11th.",PissedConsumer_Global
"The transporter called me half an hour before the time slot ended to tell me that he could not make the delivery (oven) necessary for the installation of the kitchen the next day. I lost one day waiting for him, and I have to take another day permit to wait for the oven after the kitchen has been installed. In addition, I lost another day because some pieces were delivered in advance on a different day from another vendor. IKEA never again.",PissedConsumer_Global
"My small-town post office doesn't deliver to homes; there are only PO Boxes, and if a package comes, they hold it for us. So I put in my PO Box number on my order, and unlike other websites that won't ship to PO Boxes and give you an error message SAYING SO, the Ikea website just lets it go through. Then, when it comes time to ship your items, they look and say OMG, it's a PO Box, we don't ship to them! So they look up the last address they have for you, and FedEx it to that. In my case, my PO Box is in southern California, and the last address they have for me is in Oregon. So they sent it a thousand miles away.",PissedConsumer_Global
"I kept and built a defective cabinet which I could have exchanged because I was told I would receive a $50 digital IKEA gift card as compensation. Required a ton of extra effort on my part and turned out OK but not nearly as nice as it was supposed to be. And then, no gift card in spite of 3 follow-up calls from me. (Emails are totally ignored.) More promises made but none of those happened either. AND, to make it all a lot worse, the only reviews you can give are about the agent, not about receiving any actual help. The whole situation TOTALLY sucks.",PissedConsumer_Global
"Updated by user Feb 21, 2025 Company fixed the issue and I have been provided with apology. I kept calling and emailing the company. Original review Jan 21, 2025 This entire situation has gone beyond ridiculous. I trusted IKEA to accommodate the order and complete the transaction of my new kitchen. I met three times with store personnel, and confirmed with an online planner that my order could be delivered, would be delivered, and that if I used the delivery service, ALL items on my list would be available. I then paid the amount on the invoice with that trust in place. I have made about 7 phone calls to IKEA, and have spoken with multiple people who are unable to assist in any way. This is so absurd that it deserves a full-scale evaluation and case study by anyone at IKEA who may be remotely interested in figuring out how to really mess up a customer order.  I still do not have but two small boxes delivered by FedEx a day late. What is going on? And why can IKEA not assist? No one can. Every single phone call is met with the same set of confusion.  BACKGROUND  The order has been delayed for over 3 weeks. I have made multiple calls. I have paid $10,000+ for a complete kitchen that was supposed to have been delivered on December 30, 2024. Each call to a customer service representative results in two different stories. 1. The items are not all available. 2. The delivery company is delayed. The delivery company has attempted to deliver one time on a date that was not scheduled. I was not home. This has ceased to be appropriate, or truthful, or even sane. What is going on? Why can't IKEA be honest? Manage this order? Report the situation accurately? Locate my order? Get the $10,000 in materials to my location? Redirect the order? Allow me to pick it up? Solve this situation? I have a completely gutted kitchen ready for the cabinetry and all associated parts. IKEA has no idea what's going on.  Can anyone assist? Or am I intentionally being delayed, dealt untruths, or simply caught up in an organization that has no real people in it?",PissedConsumer_Global

Let me break down the issues we encountered: Delayed Delivery and Extra Charges: We paid an additional $150 for scheduled delivery, with the promise of receiving our items within three days. However, the reality was quite different. After we paid, it took us well over a week to get a scheduled delivery.",PissedConsumer_Global
"First off, they reply in Estonian, even when requesting someone that speaks English. Id love to speak the language, but I just dont. When the delivery person did not respond when I called at a missed delivery (because he did not park at the correct apartment building..and then walked over to mine, quickly taking a photopart of the scam), I looked at my ikea.ee message and it said to contact them.

Then, when it comes time to ship your items, they look and say OMG, it's a PO Box, we don't ship to them! So they look up the last address they have for you, and FedEx it to that.

"Updated by user Feb 21, 2025 Company fixed the issue and I have been provided with apology. I kept calling and emailing the company. Original review Jan 21, 2025 This entire situation has gone beyond ridiculous. I trusted IKEA to accommodate the order and complete the transaction of my new kitchen. I met three times with store personnel, and confirmed with an online planner that my order could be delivered, would be delivered, and that if I used the delivery service, ALL items on my list would be available. I then paid the amount on the invoice with that trust in place. I have made about 7 phone calls to IKEA, and have spoken with multiple people who are unable to assist in any way. This is so absurd that it deserves a full-scale evaluation and case study by anyone at IKEA who may be remotely interested in figuring out how to really mess up a customer order.  I still do not have but two small boxes delivered by FedEx a day late. What is going on? And why can IKEA not assist? No one can. Every single phone call is met with the same set of confusion.  BACKGROUND  The order has been delayed for over 3 weeks. I have made multiple calls. I have paid $10,000+ for a complete kitchen that was supposed to have been delivered on December 30, 2024. Each call to a customer service representative results in two different stories. 1. The items are not all available. 2. The delivery company is delayed. The delivery company has attempted to deliver one time on a date that was not scheduled. I was not home. This has ceased to be appropriate, or truthful, or even sane. What is going on? Why can't IKEA be honest? Manage this order? Report the situation accurately? Locate my order? Get the $10,000 in materials to my location? Redirect the order? Allow me to pick it up? Solve this situation? I have a completely gutted kitchen ready for the cabinetry and all associated parts. IKEA has no idea what's going on.  Can anyone assist? Or am I intentionally being delayed, dealt untruths, or simply caught up in an organization that has no real people in it?",PissedConsumer_Global

"Updated by user Feb 21, 2025 Company fixed the issue and I have been provided with apology. I kept calling and emailing the company. Original review Jan 21, 2025 This entire situation has gone beyond ridiculous. I trusted IKEA to accommodate the order and complete the transaction of my new kitchen. I met three times with store personnel, and confirmed with an online planner that my order could be delivered, would be delivered, and that if I used the delivery service, ALL items on my list would be available. I then paid the amount on the invoice with that trust in place. I have made about 7 phone calls to IKEA, and have spoken with multiple people who are unable to assist in any way. This is so absurd that it deserves a full-scale evaluation and case study by anyone at IKEA who may be remotely interested in figuring out how to really mess up a customer order.  I still do not have but two small boxes delivered by FedEx a day late. What is going on? And why can IKEA not assist? No one can. Every single phone call is met with the same set of confusion.  BACKGROUND  The order has been delayed for over 3 weeks. I have made multiple calls. I have paid $10,000+ for a complete kitchen that was supposed to have been delivered on December 30, 2024. Each call to a customer service representative results in two different stories. 1. The items are not all available. 2. The delivery company is delayed. The delivery company has attempted to deliver one time on a date that was not scheduled. I was not home. This has ceased to be appropriate, or truthful, or even sane. What is going on? Why can't IKEA be honest? Manage this order? Report the situation accurately? Locate my order? Get the $10,000 in materials to my location? Redirect the order? Allow me to pick it up? Solve this situation? I have a completely gutted kitchen ready for the cabinetry and all associated parts. IKEA has no idea what's going on.  Can anyone assist? Or am I intentionally being delayed, dealt untruths, or simply caught up in an organization that has no real people in it?",PissedConsumer_Global

"Updated by user Feb 21, 2025 Company fixed the issue and I have been provided with apology. I kept calling and emailing the company. Original review Jan 21, 2025 This entire situation has gone beyond ridiculous. I trusted IKEA to accommodate the order and complete the transaction of my new kitchen. I met three times with store personnel, and confirmed with an online planner that my order could be delivered, would be delivered, and that if I used the delivery service, ALL items on my list would be available. I then paid the amount on the invoice with that trust in place. I have made about 7 phone calls to IKEA, and have spoken with multiple people who are unable to assist in any way. This is so absurd that it deserves a full-scale evaluation and case study by anyone at IKEA who may be remotely interested in figuring out how to really mess up a customer order.  I still do not have but two small boxes delivered by FedEx a day late. What is going on? And why can IKEA not assist? No one can. Every single phone call is met with the same set of confusion.  BACKGROUND  The order has been delayed for over 3 weeks. I have made multiple calls. I have paid $10,000+ for a complete kitchen that was supposed to have been delivered on December 30, 2024. Each call to a customer service representative results in two different stories. 1. The items are not all available. 2. The delivery company is delayed. The delivery company has attempted to deliver one time on a date that was not scheduled. I was not home. This has ceased to be appropriate, or truthful, or even sane. What is going on? Why can't IKEA be honest? Manage this order? Report the situation accurately? Locate my order? Get the $10,000 in materials to my location? Redirect the order? Allow me to pick it up? Solve this situation? I have a completely gutted kitchen ready for the cabinetry and all associated parts. IKEA has no idea what's going on.  Can anyone assist? Or am I intentionally being delayed, dealt untruths, or simply caught up in an organization that has no real people in it?",PissedConsumer_Global

"Updated by user Feb 21, 2025 Company fixed the issue and I have been provided with apology. I kept calling and emailing the company. Original review Jan 21, 2025 This entire situation has gone beyond ridiculous. I trusted IKEA to accommodate the order and complete the transaction of my new kitchen. I met three times with store personnel, and confirmed with an online planner that my order could be delivered, would be delivered, and that if I used the delivery service, ALL items on my list would be available. I then paid the amount on the invoice with that trust in place. I have made about 7 phone calls to IKEA, and have spoken with multiple people who are unable to assist in any way. This is so absurd that it deserves a full-scale evaluation and case study by anyone at IKEA who may be remotely interested in figuring out how to really mess up a customer order.  I still do not have but two small boxes delivered by FedEx a day late. What is going on? And why can IKEA not assist? No one can. Every single phone call is met with the same set of confusion.  BACKGROUND  The order has been delayed for over 3 weeks. I have made multiple calls. I have paid $10,000+ for a complete kitchen that was supposed to have been delivered on December 30, 2024. Each call to a customer service representative results in two different stories. 1. The items are not all available. 2. The delivery company is delayed. The delivery company has attempted to deliver one time on a date that was not scheduled. I was not home. This has ceased to be appropriate, or truthful, or even sane. What is going on? Why can't IKEA be honest? Manage this order? Report the situation accurately? Locate my order? Get the $10,000 in materials to my location? Redirect the order? Allow me to pick it up? Solve this situation? I have a completely gutted kitchen ready for the cabinetry and all associated parts. IKEA has no idea what's going on.  Can anyone assist? Or am I intentionally being delayed, dealt untruths, or simply caught up in an organization that has no real people in it?",PissedConsumer_Global

Let me break down the issues we encountered: Delayed Delivery and Extra Charges: We paid an additional $150 for scheduled delivery, with the promise of receiving our items within three days. However, the reality was quite different. After we paid, it took us well over a week to get a scheduled delivery.",PissedConsumer_Global

When the delivery person did not respond when I called at a missed delivery (because he did not park at the correct apartment building..and then walked over to mine, quickly taking a photopart of the scam), I looked at my ikea.ee message and it said to contact them. I contacted them and they said you can only get help via email. Well, thats weird, but okay. So I do.",PissedConsumer_Global

I met three times with store personnel, and confirmed with an online planner that my order could be delivered, would be delivered, and that if I used the delivery service, ALL items on my list would be available. I then paid the amount on the invoice with that trust in place. I have made about 7 phone calls to IKEA, and have spoken with multiple people who are unable to assist in any way. This is so absurd that it deserves a full-scale evaluation and case study by anyone at IKEA who may be remotely interested in figuring out how to really mess up a customer order.  I still do not have but two small boxes delivered by FedEx a day late. What is going on? And why can IKEA not assist? No one can. Every single phone call is met with the same set of confusion.  BACKGROUND  The order has been delayed for over 3 weeks. I have made multiple calls. I have paid $10,000+ for a complete kitchen that was supposed to have been delivered on December 30, 2024. Each call to a customer service representative results in two different stories. 1. The items are not all available. 2. The delivery company is delayed. The delivery company has attempted to deliver one time on a date that was not scheduled. I was not home. This has ceased to be appropriate, or truthful, or even sane. What is going on? Why can't IKEA be honest? Manage this order? Report the situation accurately? Locate my order? Get the $10,000 in materials to my location? Redirect the order? Allow me to pick it up? Solve this situation? I have a completely gutted kitchen ready for the cabinetry and all associated parts. IKEA has no idea what's going on.  Can anyone assist? Or am I intentionally being delayed, dealt untruths, or simply caught up in an organization that has no real people in it?",PissedConsumer_Global

"Original review updated Jun 17, 2024 My wife and I recently ordered a couch and throw pillows from Ikea, and unfortunately, our experience was far from satisfactory. Let me break down the issues we encountered: Delayed Delivery and Extra Charges: We paid an additional $150 for scheduled delivery, with the promise of receiving our items within three days. However, the reality was quite different. After we paid, it took us well over a week to get a scheduled delivery.",PissedConsumer_Global
"First off, they reply in Estonian, even when requesting someone that speaks English. Id love to speak the language, but I just dont. When the delivery person did not respond when I called at a missed delivery (because he did not park at the correct apartment building..and then walked over to mine, quickly taking a photopart of the scam), I looked at my ikea.ee message and it said to contact them. I contacted them and they said you can only get help via email. Well, thats weird, but okay. So I do.",PissedConsumer_Global

"Dear IKEA Customer Service Team, I hope this message finds you well. My name is Limor Hefetz, and I am writing to file a complaint regarding the unacceptable and unprofessional service I experienced at the Buyback service desk at your Paramus, New Jersey, location on March 22nd. On March 8, 2025, we received a buyback estimation for our IKEA shelving unit in 'as new' condition (Estimation Number: 137****). On March 22nd, 2025, in order to facilitate the return, we proactively purchased appropriate wrapping materials and rented a U-Haul vehicle. Upon arrival at 1:05 PM, my husband was assisted by a representative named Cristina. Her initial attitude was aggressive, indifferent, and hostile.

I still do not have but two small boxes delivered by FedEx a day late. What is going on? And why can IKEA not assist? No one can. Every single phone call is met with the same set of confusion.  BACKGROUND  The order has been delayed for over 3 weeks. I have made multiple calls. I have paid $10,000+ for a complete kitchen that was supposed to have been delivered on December 30, 2024. Each call to a customer service representative results in two different stories. 1. The items are not all available. 2. The delivery company is delayed. The delivery company has attempted to deliver one time on a date that was not scheduled. I was not home. This has ceased to be appropriate, or truthful, or even sane. What is going on? Why can't IKEA be honest? Manage this order? Report the situation accurately? Locate my order? Get the $10,000 in materials to my location? Redirect the order? Allow me to pick it up? Solve this situation? I have a completely gutted kitchen ready for the cabinetry and all associated parts. IKEA has no idea what's going on.  Can anyone assist? Or am I intentionally being delayed, dealt untruths, or simply caught up in an organization that has no real people in it?",PissedConsumer_Global
"purchased a kitchen at Ikea burbank store in october 2024 and have received 4 partial shipments but never received the bulk of the shipment and spoke to dozens of customer service representative who keep promising a delivery ""tomorrow"" that never happens",PissedConsumer_Global
"Original review updated Jun 17, 2024 My wife and I recently ordered a couch and throw pillows from Ikea, and unfortunately, our experience was far from satisfactory. Let me break down the issues we encountered: Delayed Delivery and Extra Charges: We paid an additional $150 for scheduled delivery, with the promise of receiving our items within three days. However, the reality was quite different. After we paid, it took us well over a week to get a scheduled delivery.",PissedConsumer_Global
"First off, they reply in Estonian, even when requesting someone that speaks English. Id love to speak the language, but I just dont. When the delivery person did not respond when I called at a missed delivery (because he did not park at the correct apartment building..and then walked over to mine, quickly taking a photopart of the scam), I looked at my ikea.ee message and it said to contact them. I contacted them and they said you can only get help via email. Well, thats weird, but okay. So I do.",PissedConsumer_Global
"I placed an order, paid in-store for shipping, and my order has not arrived. I called customer service a total of 10 times and I still have no answers. I have no idea what to do; I paid and received no order. Customer service is absolutely useless!",PissedConsumer_Global
IKEA no te devuelve el dinero si te roban el paquete ni te manda un remplazo de tu paquete que mal s,PissedConsumer_Global
"I had a scheduled appointment with the online kitchen planning and a link was sent via email at 8:30 AM that expired in 30 minutes. My appointment was for 11:00 AM, I didn't see the link until it was time to connect. I called customer service; they stated the planner would send me another link, but it never happened. It has been 45 minutes and this is very frustrating and disappointing. I hope IKEA can be more reliable with the service they are providing.",PissedConsumer_Global
"I have purchased one of your Tingby rollaround tables and I have one of the casters that are broken. I need a replacement part, in white, so that I can use the table again. Tell me how to get one and if there is a charge for it please. Thank you in advance",PissedConsumer_Global
I have been waiting for them to send me a part that I need for my Havsta hutch since May 2024. I can not use the hutch until I receive the part. Ive spent so much time on the phone requesting this part and they never do what they say they will.,PissedConsumer_Global

"Service Failures, Hygiene Violations & Staff Misconduct . I placed an order on Jan 21 (Order #1577191961) and paid €75 for premium delivery. It has been a total disaster.

Ghosted & Lost Item: They missed the first delivery entirely. Because of their error, they canceled the order and I lost a rug I wanted because it went out of stock.

Missing Items: On the rescheduled delivery, the paperwork and stickers indicated 3 sections of the delivery, but I only received partial items.

Unsanitary: They delivered the items in a supermarket cart, loose and unpackaged. Towels were left on the dirty floor.

Rude Service: I called immediately to fix the missing items. The hold time was so long I was late to a doctor's appointment. When I finally got through, the agent told me it was a ""useless conversation"" and hung up on me.

Chaos: They have created and canceled multiple re-orders for the missing items. My main large item is still delayed until Feb 5th.

IKEA logistics are broken. Do not order online",Trustpilot_USA

"Ikea is a big scam . Ikea is a big scam, I purchased on 12/20 many items worth of 1700 dollars of items, they shipped some of them and the others they sent an email saying some pieces are out of stock, so I called them and told them I can’t build the cabinet, desk and night stand with missing items, so I will return everything, they charged me for the pickup and they stole my money, never got my refund despite not even opening the boxes, every time I call, they keep saying it will take 7-14 days, it has been more than a month and 10days and still no money returned!",Trustpilot_USA
"Missing delivery- no communication . I am still waiting to receive the goods I ordered. IKEA received full payment, more than $2,500.00 on the 6th January. Delivery was advised to be on the 20th. Due to the size of the delivery and our health issues I organised helpers to be on stand by. Today is the 31st. I contacted IKEA numerous times but they were unable to help. Neither them nor I could reach Mainfreight. Mainfreight has not contacted me to date either. This is a very disappointing situation considering that the eta according to the app is still the 20.02.2026. The furniture at home has been pulled to bits to fit all the new shelves.

This makes shopping feel safe and hassle-free, even when plans change.

Delivery times are generally short, and I really appreciate that most products are consistently available at my nearest warehouse. This makes both planning and last-minute purchases much easier.

The showrooms are very inspirational and help turn ideas into real solutions, especially when renovating or furnishing larger spaces. The website is also well designed and easy to use, with good planning tools and plenty of inspiration that make it simple to prepare before visiting the store.

"Terrible delivery/collection service . This evening I drove from my home in Reading to a Tesco store in High Wycombe – a distance of 18 miles in rush hour traffic as my Ikea pick up appointment was between 5pm and 7pm. I got there at 6.25 pm and the collection point was supposedly in the car park but there was no sign of an Ikea lorry or van.
I received a text from Ikea at 6.34pm to say that my delivery was cancelled even though this was 25 minutes before the latest time that I could collect!!!
Obviously the driver could not be bothered to wait until 7pm and he/she should be disciplined as this has cost me 3 hours of my life and I have incurred the costs of travel without receiving my item.

"Cancelled order without valid reason . I have ordered from Ikea online and decided to be delivered to a pick up point (it's a 2 hour slot and i thought it was convenient). Yesterday i had a phone call from the driver saying that the van is broken and the order was delayed so it will arrive later on. After some time, i have received a text saying that my order was cancelled (without any reason). Later on, an e-mail saying i didn't pick up my parcel on time and i have missed it !!!

I have contacted the customer service and they said the order was cancelled internally and she doesn't know the reason (i bet she didn't). They offered a refund or home delivery (in the next 7 days, but not in the next 48 hours as theh don't have enough staff) but the home delivery would be a 4 hour slot (to bare in mind that sometimes could be delayed).
I have chosen refund and now i need to wait 14 days to have my money back and i have lost a full day of work (i took a day off on Saturday to be able to install everything by Sunday when the guests are coming). Now i have nothing: no money back yet, no products.

"SCAM AT RETURNS DEPARTMENT . SCAM AT RETURNS DEPARTMENT IKEA

Terrible experience – IKEA Bangalore Returns is unethical
IKEA Bangalore’s returns department is a complete scam. I ordered a wardrobe for 4th February, but they delivered it early on 18th January without my consent or knowledge. I paid ₹2,32,000 in cash, and now they refuse to return it the same way, insisting only on a bank transfer and endlessly delaying the refund.
The returns staff, including Rahul Sinha and a female staff member, were extremely rude, abusive, and harassing. I was made to feel humiliated and treated as if my money was being held to ransom. This behaviour is unacceptable, unethical, and deeply unprofessional.
I live in the UK and have shopped at IKEA in London and other parts of the UK many times—the service there is excellent. IKEA Bangalore, however, is one of the worst customer experiences I’ve ever had.

Instead of answering clearly, I was:

* transferred between agents
* asked to call different numbers
* told to place an order without confirming delivery
* ignored or given copied/pasted replies
* answered in different languages without understanding my question

I repeated the same question many times and never received a clear **yes or no**.
The agents did not seem to understand the issue and kept redirecting me instead of helping.

Very disappointing experience for a brand like IKEA.

"I’ve generally had good experiences… . Writing on behalf of my partner

I’ve generally had good experiences with IKEA over the years, which is why this has genuinely surprised me.

On 3 Jan 2026 I collected order 1572117350. The click & collect car park gates were locked, so I had to park around 250m away and carry three ~30kg parcels multiple trips to my car. I sustained a physical injury as a direct result and it is ongoing.

I raised a formal complaint and was given Case ID 509 095 42. Since then I’ve chased repeatedly by phone and spent a disproportionate amount of time just trying to get basic information. I only discovered by calling that my complaint had been opened in the wrong department, leaving it idle for 10+ days.

I’m now far less surprised to see how poor IKEA’s customer service reviews are online - my experience suggests there’s very limited ownership or care once something goes wrong.
I’m still waiting for a named case owner, confirmation of what’s been investigated, and a proper resolution. I will update this review in two weeks if IKEA responds and resolves the issue.",Trustpilot_USA
"DO NOT BUY AN IKEA/WHIRLPOOL DISHWASHER!! . DO NOT BUY AN IKEA DISHWASHER!!! THEY LEAK AFTER 3 MONTHS AND DO NOT CLEAN. The dishwasher gets clogged by the smallest particles.

Its a shame whirlpool partnered up with Ikea it will impact there name as well. The dishwasher will also run for 4 hrs. Id much rather a less""efficient"" dishwasher that actual cleans. The cheese paper like filter catches food and sprays it back into the dishes gluing the particles on causing you to scrub your dishes harder than you would have if you just washed them by hand. I tried running the dishwasher without the filter to allow food particles do get flushed down the drain. This did not change a thing. I customized the arms by drilling larger holes to allow a larger stream and to allow food to pas through. This worked well dishes actually came out clean however it wasn't long until the film came back. I think the dishwasher does not use enough water to try and be more ""eco"" friendly thus causing dishes to have soap and food residue left on. Can't believe we let companies get away with this type of thing. Quality used to matter now not so much.

"I purchased a light fitting from IKEA . I purchased a light fitting from IKEA, only to discover when I came to install it that a ceiling hook was required but not included. This was not made clear at the point of purchase, and the hook was not displayed anywhere near the product. I later found out it’s sold separately for just 50p, which made the situation even more frustrating.

Because of this, I had no choice but to make a second trip to the store on a busy Saturday. Between traffic, parking, navigating the store, and queuing, it took two hours just to buy a 50p bracket. This inconvenience could easily have been avoided with clearer information or better product pairing.

When I contacted customer services to raise the issue, the experience was just as disappointing. I was met with an extremely argumentative response and told that many homes already have a ceiling hook, so IKEA sees no reason to include one. That completely misses the point — if a product cannot be installed without an additional part, customers should be clearly told before they buy it.

What makes this worse is that reviews of the hook going back several years show this is not a new issue, yet nothing appears to have been done to improve the customer experience.

For a company known for good design and customer focus, this was a genuinely poor experience. A simple warning at checkout or automatic prompt to buy the hook would prevent a lot of frustration. As it stands, this feels careless and unacceptable.",Trustpilot_USA
"A truly dreadful experience . What a truly dreadful experience. Such a shame. I ordered multiple storage containers. They couldn't be delivered to my home address for some reason.

Turns out I had to actually BE there and pick up from a vehicle. I've never heard of such a way of pickup.

The driver on the phone was friendly, said it happened many times but that he had to leave as I would be 5 minutes past the slot if I rushed over immediately. But he also explained that the delivery would likely be back the next day as he'd told ikea of the issue.

Within 1 minute of the call I received notification my order was cancelled and that I'd get a refund!!

I tried to resolve the situation online but there were no contact methods. So I requested a new order of the same items. However half the items were then not available!

Such a frustrating and stupid way to do business. Why on earth couldn't I simply reschedule! After all I was paying for delivery both times. I'm not impressed at all. What an unprofessional, obtuse way to do delivery.",Trustpilot_USA

"Unnecessary journey, incorrect information, and dismissive customer service . I’ve been a regular IKEA customer for years, but this experience has been extremely disappointing.

In early January I placed a Click & Collect order at the Lakeside branch after IKEA confirmed the items were ready for collection. This was the only reason I travelled there instead of my local store.

When I arrived, the items were not there. The receipt even had a handwritten note saying they were out of stock.

This meant I made a completely unnecessary journey, including crossing the Dartford Tunnel, costing me money and time – all due to incorrect information provided by IKEA.

I contacted customer services by phone (30+ minute wait) and live chat (45+ minute wait). I was initially told the toll costs would be refunded, but this never happened.

Instead, IKEA later offered a £10 e-voucher as a “goodwill gesture” (not cash), and stated they do not compensate travel costs. When I declined, they warned the voucher could be withdrawn.

At no point did anyone properly acknowledge that the journey happened because IKEA’s system said the order was ready when it wasn’t.

Mistakes happen – but the handling of this was poor:

Incorrect stock information

Wasted journey

Long waits to speak to anyone

Broken promises

Dismissive tone when raising a formal complaint

"Assembly with Taskrabbit is not guaranteed . I ordered a piece of furniture (wardrobe) that required a complicated assembly. Assembling myself was not option. I ordered it because it came with an option to pay for the assembly service, which I selected. In the order confirmation it said that my assembly was scheduled for the day that was 2 days after my delivery date, and no actions were required.
That day came and went, but no body showed up. I called Ikia and they said I need to contact Taskrabbit who is supposed to handle all their assembly tasks.
Taskrabbit said they were unable to find a tasker for that day and they will notify me when they have someone. Their system is very misleading, because it kept saying I have a task scheduled for a certain date, but in fact it never was. And then they kept sending me messages, but when you click on the link you get a 404 error. So I had to keep calling them and they kept telling they still have no tasker. Ikia seemed to be pretty disconnected from Taskrabbit, because in their system it said the task was scheduled with someone.
Basically the end results was after spending hours on multiple phone calls with Taskrabbit and Ikia for the following 10 days (mostly trying to reach a person to talk to or being on hold), I returned the order.
It does seem like Taskrabbit was the source of most of my pain. However Ikia did not communicate that the assembly is not guaranteed. If I knew I would have never placed that order.

I ordered a wardrobe on 02/01/26, with the initial delivery scheduled for 09/01. On the delivery day, the app showed “order on the way”, so I took an unpaid day off work to wait at home.

A few days later, I received yet another email changing the delivery date to 20/01, again requesting payment for an order that was already paid for.
This whole experience has been extremely disorganised, frustrating, and unprofessional. IKEA has now delayed delivery until 20/01, claiming they do not have the capacity, despite this being entirely their fault. I lost time, money, and confidence in a company I expected better from.

"Worst customer service ever!! . I ordered a bed and mattress for my son as a birthday present. We placed the order well in advance to make sure it would arrive in time for his birthday. Both my husband and I stayed home from work to receive the items. On the day of the delivery, the mattress was missing from the order. I called IKEA and was told ""it had been removed from the order"" by someone at IKEA and that a new delivery would have to be scheduled but that it could not be arranged for another week (so arriving AFTER my son's birthday). Additionally, I was not told I would have to reenter my payment information, so the redelivery of the mattress was cancelled later that evening without my knowledge.

We decided we would give our son the bed on his birthday and use his old mattress until a new mattress arrived. On his birthday, we began to assemble the bed only to discover that an ENTIRE BOX was missing (we had disassembled his old bed at this point). I called IKEA immediately the next day, and, at first, they could not explain why I received only 2/3 of the bed (they proposed that ""it might have been left at another location"" or ""it was a mistake at the warehouse""). They scheduled a redelivery of the missing box for what they told me was a full week later. At this point, after I expressed my dissatisfaction at the situation, I was offered a 300 kr IKEA gift card as compensation for the inconvenience.

When I later checked the confirmation email, however, I saw it was actually for a month later!! I called back yet again and was told that actually the bed was out of stock, and I wouldn't be able to get it EVER. Also, I would have to stay home from work yet another full day so that they could pick up the 2/3 of the bed before I could get my money back. I called again to confirm the pickup time and to confirm that I would also be refunded for the delivery fee, given we had received neither the bed nor the mattress. I was told that I could not be refunded for the delivery!!!! We pressed IKEA to explain the logic of this decision, but we were only told that the representative had talked to her colleague (presumably the person who handled the original case) and that this decision was final.

It should be obvious that we should not be required to pay for delivery of items that, through no fault of our own, we NEVER RECEIVED!

The level of disorganization and incompetence throughout this process has been shocking. Why would IKEA send 2/3 of a bed if the bed was out of stock? Why was the mattress removed from the order? Why were we further inconvenienced by having to schedule a pickup and stay home from work yet again when it was clearly IKEA's mistake? Why charge us (and refuse to refund us) for the delivery of a mattress and bed that we NEVER received!? As a result of this situation, we are without a bed and birthday present, out 349 kr in delivery fees, have spent hours on the phone with IKEA, and my son is sleeping on an air mattress for the foreseeable future :(

"Homophobic discrimination and aggressive behavior by security . I am writing this negative review regarding a homophobic security guard at IKEA on Oxford Street (214 Oxford St, London W1C 1DA). Today, Jan 9, 2026, around 7:00 PM, I visited the store to shop. Initially, I was simply filming for myself. However, a security guard approached me and rudely began prohibiting me from using my phone.
He was very hostile and spoke in a loud, confrontational voice, trying to convince me I wasn't allowed to film. Because of his aggressive behavior, I continued filming him directly for my own safety to document the incident. He kept insistently repeating that I ""had no right"" to film him and must turn my phone off, while he was simultaneously recording me with his Body-Worn Camera (BWC).
I demanded a manager, but he flatly refused. Another woman approached (not a manager) and also tried to stop me. I told her that this guard clearly has homophobic tendencies because another female customer was filming at the same time, yet he didn't say a word to her. He targeted only me.
This is direct discrimination and homophobia. IKEA claims to support the LGBTQ+ community, yet they employ staff with such biased attitudes. I left without buying anything. I have a continuous video recording of the entire conflict. IKEA, I expect an investigation into this guard's conduct.",Trustpilot_USA

Hello!

Thank you for a nice call.

In order to procced with your claim on the dishwasher we need to have the invoice for the installation of the first one.

When we get that invoice we can book delivery of the new dishwasher and book so someone comes out and install it for you.

Have a nice day.

"I purchased a gift card on line on the 12 October 2025 . I purchased a gift card on line on the 12 October 2025 for my brother's wedding gift. Since their wedding my brother has tried endlessly to use the gift. He has tried in line as well as in store. Each time he is given a different set of reasons for him not being able to use the card. Over two weeks ago when he made one last attempt to use this to purchase the item on line he contacted IKEA and they agreed to refund the money to my credit card and he was advised this would take 5 days. I called after 7 days and was advised by staff I should wait until after 10 days. It has gone 3 weeks and I called the store to be told today that they had made a mistake on the card and therefore I now have to wait a further 10 days for this to be resolved.
I have since gone into the store on the 22 December and purchase another gift card. Even then the staff was experiencing challenges as they were asked the same question about a pin number
It took them one day to take the money from the credit card and 4 weeks for them to credit the money back to the card. I am absolutely disappointed with the service I have received.

"DO NOT COUNT ON CUSTOMER SERVICE AT… . DO NOT COUNT ON CUSTOMER SERVICE AT IKEA.

Customer service at IKEA is absolutely the worst I've ever experienced. I have NO complaints against the customer service agents. But IKEA's system is a nightmare to navigate; complicated and time consuming beyond all reason. And their follow-up is useless, designed to waste your time.

I was unable to track delivery of a gift to an out of state friend. Days were going by and I had no idea whether it had even been shipped. After several contacts with IKEA I was told the item was damaged in transit and would need to be replaced with another. At the end of that chat IKEA wanted feedback, and I listed the problems I encountered and made some suggestions. No response. The next day the original shipment arrived.

Later I got a series of emails from them stating they needed to speak with me to resolve the case. They did not indicate their initial reaction or whether they had read my feedback. I am convinced that no one at IKEA actually reads feedback. (Judging from their rating on TrustPilot I can see why.) Plus, the link provided in their email did NOT connect me directly to customer service. (WHY NOT??) Instead they want me to dig around the website, and go through a series of verifications, before reaching someone who would say nice things and do nothing.

"Inadequate product support options . This review is relating to appliance customer support policy not to personnel (IKEA Canada), who I have had overall good experiences with.

I used to like IKEA for product that required some DIY-ing, was reasonably priced for the quality given and overall great experiences at the stores.

But then I bought kitchen cabinets and appliances (at full price). It took me longer than expected to finish the project (DIY) and I was keeping all parts originally packaged until ready to install them. The stove was the last piece to go in. The rim (edge that's mounted on the stove top and is parallel to the wall), was packaged and placed in the oven. The package and the part looked like burnt by a cigarette and the rim had some scratches on it too. I wouldn't make a fuss about the part if the damage wasn't on the surface that would be visible once installed.

I asked IKEA if they could replace that part only. IKEA offered 5% discount (not even $50) or that I pay for stove p/u or that I return the stove and get a new one from the store. I'm concluding they simply count on people not returning damaged products (the stove itself is heavy to move up/down the stairs, let alone lift without a pump truck).

The kitchen looks amazing, without this part installed on the stove as of yet. I will be limiting my purchases at IKEA going forward.",Trustpilot_USA

"IKEA's delivery charges are a scam; BEWARE! . I ordered three matching bookcases from IKEA, to assemble as one bookcase as in the picture on the IKEA website. I paid for home delivery. A day before the delivery, IKEA wrote to me to say that I would only receive two of the three bookcases. I called and asked whether IKEA could deliver the third bookcase another day, or whether I could cancel or change the order. IKEA said no.

On the delivery day, I contacted IKEA through its customer chat. I got through to a human being, who said that if I returned the two bookcases I could not use as they were smaller than what I had ordered, IKEA would not charge me for pickup. Chat conversations are emailed to the customer and so this promise in writing.

I never received the refund.

IKEA then wrote to me to say that it had not supplied the bookcase to me because it was out of stock, and then said that I had 'changed my mind' and therefore I was not entitled to a refund of the delivery charge or the pickup charge.

This is of course nonsensical. IKEA admits it changed my order because it didn't have the item I paid for. Of course I didn't change my mind.

Finally I re-ordered the bookcases in a different colour, and they arrived.

All in all, I have paid around 100 euros extra, because I paid for the bookcases to be delivered twice, and I paid for IKEA to pickup the bookcases I could not use.

Never use IKEA home delivery, because they do not feel obligated to deliver the items you have ordered and paid for, and they will charge you nonetheless for the delivery and for the pickup if you return something you cannot use because IKEA did not supply the complete order.

Despite this, instead of issuing a refund, IKEA Amsterdam required the box of broken glass to be returned. In practice, this meant expecting the customer to collect, store, and carry hazardous shards back for return, putting themselves and others at risk. For obvious safety reasons, we disposed of the box to prevent injuries. As a result, no refund was issued.

When unwell recently it did not stop any liquids from vomitting passing through the advertised 'waterproof cover'. It completely ruined the mattress it was advertised to protect.

They also collected the mattress cover with seur stating they would be testing it which I believed but it appears they have not done this as no results were discussed with me. Taking my complaint further they refused to replace the mattress that was damaged and only a year old despite me providing receipts because I did not purchase it from IKEA. Despite their own advisor agreeing that I should be given a replacement or equal value or refund of the mattress we lost ...I was told to go and speak with the oficina de consumidores as they should refund me?!! A total disgrace. I have spoken today with the oficina de consumidores and I am waiting for IKEA to respond to my email from five days ago. They refused by telephone (agents name I have noted also) to pass me to s supervisor, or to send me a pdf copy of the case and complaint open and basically passed the buck to the office of consumidores. I have a case number and emails and will await assistance when IKEA have the nerve to confirm in writing that they aren't going to do anything about replacing the mattress we lost because of a cover that was not 'waterproof' as they advertised on their website. I also have screenshots of reviews on their own website of customers who have had the very same issues with the sheet not being waterproof at all?! .

How they are allowed to continue selling this product is disgraceful. They should have the decency to remove it from sales until it is investigated as to why this is not an isolated incident as a mattress for a child bed is anything from 80 euros or more. Therefore the refund of the supposed waterproof sheet doesn't cover the loss of the dashed item it failed to protect.
I have been informed by the office of consumidores that IKEA when confronted with their errors have a team of lawyers that work to eliminate any possibility of reclamation's.

There was nothing they could do and asked if we would like to reschedule. FOR FEBRUARY! We asked to have a manager call to see what options we had. We tried calling (good luck with that!) and never did get a call or connect with anyone that may be able to help. so we called the 800 number and told them to come pick up all of their stuff and refund it because we could not wait for a kitchen for almost 3 months! They just said sure someone will call you to arrange pick up. Again, no call. a few days later we got a call ""we are on our way"" uhhh on your way for what? Well, it was a shipping company on the way to get the cabinets. We were never notified. So they took the cabinets and it is now over 4 weeks later and still no return calls and no refund. We called yet again and were told we would get a call to get us the refund. that was 7 days ago and no call and no refund. So to recap, they messed up the delivery, didn't offer any help or solution. They finally picked up the cabinets but still no refund and it is impossible to get an actual person to help you. They did confirm that the cabinets were back at their warehouse so they DO have the product. for the record, the refund we are due is almost $8,000.

"1 star . 1 star – IKEA refuses to resolve a clear case of non-delivery and breach of contract

I ordered and fully paid for a wardrobe from IKEA Groningen, including delivery to the first floor and assembly.

What followed has been over two months of delays, contradictions and avoidance of responsibility.

Facts:
– The transport company refused to deliver to the first floor, despite this service being paid for.
– IKEA later acknowledged an internal transport error.
– The second delivery was incomplete (missing essential parts), making the wardrobe unusable.
– Assembly was never completed; parts remain uninstalled.
– I formally terminated the contract due to breach of contract.

Since then, IKEA has:
– Passed my case between 20 different customer service agents.
– Provided contradictory explanations.
– Repeatedly promised “escalation” and “updates” without action.
– Ultimately refused to refund, while claiming the case is “closed”.

I am not asking for goodwill I am asking for what the law requires:
a refund for a product that was never delivered or usable as agreed.

This experience shows a complete lack of ownership, accountability and customer respect.
If this is how IKEA handles clear failures, customers should be aware before ordering.

"Terrible experience - never using IKEA again! . An experience so bad I ended up taking notes so that I could make a formal complaint...

Tuesday 18th Nov, order was delivered damaged at 8.54am. Damage was a puncture through the cardboard packaging and through one of the shelves of the Kallax unit. The delivery driver told me that he’d been unable to contact me prior to delivery, and when he showed me the phone number he’d rung it was the number of my previous address in Cambridgeshire from four years earlier. This number does not appear in my User Profile settings and I am unable to change it. I rang IKEA and reported the damaged parts and that they’d used an old phone number that I wasn’t able to edit online. Replacement part was scheduled for 19th Nov. Return of broken part scheduled for 25th Nov.

Monday 19th Nov, replacement parts delivered 11.34am. No call from drivers - they’d again been given the old landline number. I was very surprised that the delivery drivers weren’t also tasked with picking up the packages that need to be returned, but IKEA clearly think that sending out another van on a separate occasion is a better way to handle this situation.

Nov 25th IKEA failed to arrive. Once again they’d been given the wrong phone number. I rang IKEA, reported the wrong phone number problem (this was the third time I’d notified IKEA of this problem) and collection was re-scheduled for Thursday 4th Dec.

Dec 4th: IKEA texted me (so they are actually capable of using my mobile number!) to say that collection would NOT take place (“:due to unforeseen circumstances”) and that I have to ring IKEA to reschedule the collection. I rang and re-scheduled the collection for 12th Dec, and this time I requested compensation due to the repeated failure of IKEA to provide adequate customer service for this order.
Got email from IKEA Customer Services asking me for more details why I wanted a refund. I replied to the email and it bounced back as a bad address. I rang customer services (the 4th time so far) and explained all this and the lady has issued me a voucher to spend at IKEA.

Dec 12th: awaiting collection of the returned items for the third time. Rang IKEA on 11th, they said the delivery slot would be between 14.45 and 18.45.
9.20am on 12th still no written message from IKEA to confirm the delivery time, so I’m wondering if they’ve been given the wrong phone number again. I rang IKEA helpline and the guy confirmed that they now only hold my mobile number on record. He did say that he didn’t know what the delivery slot was, which contradicted the info given to me by the lady yesterday. He said that the driver would contact me about 45 mins before collection.

The second attempt was even worse. Delivery dates were changed multiple times at the last minute—one change came at 11 PM the night before. After over an hour on the phone with IKEA, a new time slot was agreed: Thursday between 12 PM and 8 PM. However, the night before, I received a message saying the delivery would be between 8 AM and 10 AM instead. To make matters worse, the drivers showed up at 6:30 AM, forcing me to completely rearrange my schedule and even turn back from my commute to work.
This experience caused unnecessary stress, wasted time, and disrupted multiple plans—not just mine, but also for others involved. While IKEA’s customer service was polite, the execution was unacceptable. IKEA must take responsibility for its delivery partners and ensure paid services are honored.
This experience has seriously damaged my trust in IKEA and will influence my future purchasing decisions.",Trustpilot_USA

"rotten lettuce and nonfriendly staff . Yesterday we had a very unpleasant shopping experience at IKEA. First, the dining area: we went to the restaurant around 11:30, and there were already many people in line, but there were obviously not enough staff serving food or working at the cash registers. About one-third of the lettuce in the salad was rotten and stuck to the leaves that still looked edible. I carried my bowl to find a staff member to tell them they should check and replace those vegetables, but I couldn’t find anyone in charge at all. In other areas where customers needed help, staff were also lacking.

Second, the pickup (Portland, Oregon): we bought a sofa and a mattress that had to be collected from a warehouse not far from the store. I don’t mind that, but the parking lot at the pickup site was extremely small—so small that even a 4x8 trailer couldn’t make the turn. Moreover, when facing more than 300 pounds of goods, none of the staff at the pickup area even asked whether we needed help.",Trustpilot_USA

"Never choose delivery service . I placed an order worth €1,095 and scheduled my delivery for Tuesday, 18 November 2025. IKEA confirmed the delivery window as 10:00–14:00. I reorganised my entire day around this—took time off work, rescheduled commitments, and made sure I was home and ready. I tracked the delivery link they sent me and could see the van getting close.

Then, at around 12:00, I looked out my window and saw the IKEA van right outside my apartment. I immediately grabbed my jacket and checked my phone—no call, no message, nothing. By the time I looked again, the van was gone. They didn’t even attempt to contact me. I even took a photo of the van outside my building as proof. There was plenty of parking available. There is absolutely no excuse.

I called (01) 696 6246 and was told they had *no idea* what happened. So I walked to IKEA myself and spoke to customer service at 2 PM. They then tried to claim the driver “attempted delivery” at 1:10 PM—an outright lie. I was home at that exact time. It only takes 15 minutes to walk from my apartment to IKEA; it’s about 5 minutes by car. Their story makes no sense.

Even worse, the staff told me they have “no way to contact the delivery drivers.” How is that even possible for a major company? All they could offer was another delivery date, with zero explanation of what went wrong. After wasting my entire day waiting for a delivery that never even attempted to happen, how am I supposed to trust the rescheduled one? I cannot afford that risk again.

Because of this complete failure, I requested a refund. I had already hired someone to assemble the furniture, and now everything is ruined. This entire experience has been one of the most frustrating and disappointing customer service situations I’ve ever dealt with.

IKEA’s delivery service has been an absolute failure from start to finish. I have photographic proof the van was at my apartment and never made any attempt to deliver or contact me.",Trustpilot_USA

When I questioned the team, they claimed that “room delivery was not on their manifest,” even though my order included assembly. At no point during the purchase process was it mentioned that room delivery needed to be requested separately it’s only logical that items should be placed where assembly will occur.

Unfortunately, this isn’t the first time I’ve had issues with IKEA’s delivery process. Their assembly service is handled by third-party contractors, and customer service cannot access or reschedule these appointments. This makes resolving any issues extremely difficult.

Overall, IKEA’s after-sales support is poor, and communication between their teams is lacking. The process feels disjointed, and customers are left to manage problems on their own.

IKEA needs to improve coordination between delivery, assembly, and customer support, and ensure that key service details such as delivery as intended are clearly communicated upfront.",Trustpilot_USA

After months of delays and frustration, I involved a lawyer through the legal aid service in Cologne. Instead of working through my lawyer, IKEA’s representative, Tina Deutscher, reached out to me directly and offered €500 if I would drop the case. When my lawyer reminded her that communication should go through legal channels, IKEA withdrew the offer, accused me of “not cooperating,” and then closed the case entirely.

I have tried to contact her and IKEA Global again, but no one replies. The kitchen remains unfinished, the damage to my home is still there, and IKEA has taken no responsibility.

Two weeks ago, we bought a sofa at IKEA Avenida da República (Lisbon).
Since then, we’ve been living through a complete nightmare of failures, rescheduling, and total lack of respect for the customer.

🔹 The delivery has been rescheduled three times, always due to “unforeseen circumstances” with no credible explanation.
🔹 We spent hours on the phone with customer support, even agreeing to skip the assembly just to finally receive the sofa.
🔹 We even received a confirmation email for the new delivery — only to have it canceled again a few hours later, with no explanation.

Two weeks later, the sofa still hasn’t been delivered, the payment was made in full, and IKEA keeps repeating that they “regret the inconvenience.”

We feel deceived, disrespected, and completely ignored by a brand that claims to put the customer first.

We expect an urgent resolution and hope IKEA will review how it treats its customers and manages its delivery partners.

"IKEA Bed Purchase - AVOID AT ALL COST . IKEA Kura Bed Purchase

Order placed: September 14, 2025
Promised delivery: September 25, 2025
Actual status: Still not delivered as of November 4, 2025

I ordered the Kura bed on September 14th, with a promised delivery date of September 25th. Every other item in the order arrived on time—except the bed itself. The delivery date was first postponed to October 14th. Two days before that date, it was adjusted again to October 16th. When I called customer service, I was assured the bed was “allocated” and that the delivery date would not change again.

However, on October 14th I received yet another message stating the new delivery date was October 21st. By this point my children had already been sleeping on mattresses on the floor for several weeks. I contacted customer service again, and they created a new order from another warehouse with a “really confirmed” delivery date of October 24th.

When October 24th came—no delivery. I called again and was told the new date was October 25th. Once more, no delivery. After repeated calls, the case was escalated, and I was told the bed could be sourced from the Charlotte warehouse, but that location does not offer deliveries. I asked if IKEA could compensate me for driving the 4-hour round trip to collect it myself—no.

When I requested to file a formal complaint, I was told there was no such process. A manager promised to get back to me, but it is now November 4th and I have received no response. My children are still sleeping on the floor, and the customer service representatives I speak with each time have no idea what has happened with my order.

As someone from Sweden, I have always been proud of IKEA and its reputation for reliability and service. Sadly, this experience has been deeply disappointing and far from the standards I once associated with the company.

Summary:

Over seven weeks since ordering — no delivery.

Delivery date changed multiple times (Sept 25 → Oct 14 → Oct 16 → Oct 21 → Oct 24 → Oct 25).

Customer service inconsistent, unable to provide accurate information.

No escalation or complaint process. No managers that want to take responsibility.

No compensation offered despite repeated inconvenience.

"Ikea is such an amazing company they don’t even have a complaints department!!!!! . I purchased my kitchen in the spring and then had the fit date set for end of June beginning of July. Everything went well and I am excited albeit a bit stressed with all the upheaval.

The first week of October I noticed on the black Tollsjon tap that cost £179, area which is now silver as the paint appeared to have come off. I contact IKEA by phone on the 11th October and spoke with a lovely chap who explained I would need send photos in via email and he gave me the address. I took the photos straight away and then also noticed small other areas.

I emailed over with the information.

By 18th October no one had got back to me so sent email again. Still no one replied, not even a ‘we aim to respond with x amount of days’

On the 28 October I called and spoke to some young lad, who was lovely and polite and I was very calm, as I don’t believe in being rude to the workers. He found my emails and said he was pass them on and we even got a reply whilst I was still on the phone.

I had explained, as I did in previous emails that I did not want a replacement as I had seen some reviews with the same issue and would like a refund.

The chap then said I could not have a refund as it’s cosmetic, after laughing asked if I could speak to that team and was told no.

I asked if he had a manager I could speak with and again was told there wasn’t one
so, lastly I asked for Ikeas complaints departments contact details to then be told there was not one of these either.

I was still laughing and asked how can multi international company not have a complaints department and asked so they have never had a complaint!

I still couldn’t be rude to the lad, but please be very careful with what you buy.

I have never had a new kitchen before so was being guided by the Ikea kitchen designer who was also lovely. I partly blame myself for not reading reviews for the taps sink etc, I just did it for the full kitchen. Surely if this is an issue with the tap people should be made aware

We spoke to customer service who said they can refund or replace with a different colour but not what we had ordered.

There is no way to escalate the complaint as the whole space had been built around the kitchen measurements, carpenters booked, colour compatible items like tiles , flooring paint etc this is a very expensive mistake to use ikea. Most likely we will now have to replace with white when the order was blue. Ikea refuse to discuss any compensation or additional expenses until they have either collected the whole kitchen and refunded or replaced the whole kitchen with white. This makes it very difficult as we would like to spray the doors as to the colour we ordered and I think it is fair that Ikea should help with this as they have had plenty of time to tell us about not having the stock and we would have had the time to go elsewhere. As they won’t discuss any of this before we decide our decision is based on a best guess.

That’s completely unacceptable.I had already paid two people to carry the boxes upstairs because I have a back problem, and my daughter has been sleeping on a mattress on the floor since last week.

The only person who ever replied to any message was the technician who was supposed to assemble the furniture — no one else from IKEA even bothered to respond.

💬 It’s shocking how little IKEA UK cares about its customers.
No communication.
No responsibility.
No respect for people’s time or money.

IKEA may seem affordable, but once you add the frustration, delays, and extra costs for delivery and assembly, it’s one of the worst shopping experiences I’ve ever had.",Trustpilot_USA

I was not impressed with this.

Noisy background as staff were moving furniture during our meal. I thought the world was coming to the end honestly.

I would not recommend coming here.

"Horrible Customer Service . Purchased item online, only for it to arrive damaged. It took 4 attempts contacting customer service and 45 days to receive a refund. Made a special trip to purchase this item in store, 4 hours away from home. Before checking out in-store, I was told they would adjust the now doubled price to the price I paid online at the returns/customer service counter. At the customer service counter, I was literally told, ""That's not my job"" by the rep because the original purchase was made online, and directed to contact online customer service for a price adjustment. I had to call online customer service 3 times and received emails in between those calls stating that they tried to call me and that I needed to call them back. I never received a call. On the third call, I was told that it was against their policy to adjust the price. Why did five separate people tell me I would get a price adjustment, only to be told it was against policy? Why is IKEA customer service so bad now?",Trustpilot_USA

After just a few weeks the material/coating on the Tollsjon mixer tap started peeling off. I sent photos to IKEA and they said I’d caused the issue by cleaning it. I hadn’t even told them what I’d been cleaning the tap with (and that point, I’d only been wiping it dry with a soft tea towel!) so unwilling to replace the tap under the supposedly 25 year guarantee that they offer! Since looking at the reviews of this particular tap on the IKEA website, it’s clearly a known issue with the tap and coating.

"Practical furniture, but delivery isn’t perfect . IKEA has been my go-to place for simple, functional furniture and home essentials for a long time. I like that their product range is easy to navigate - everything is clearly arranged, so even if you come without a strict plan, you usually end up finding what you need. The quality is fair for the price: nothing premium, but sturdy enough to last, and the design fits well with most interiors.

However, the delivery part can really test your patience. A few times the delivery arrived later than the agreed time, and once the assembly team didn’t show up at all until the next day. That’s not a huge disaster, but when you’ve arranged your day around receiving furniture, it’s pretty frustrating. Also, communication with the delivery service isn’t always smooth - you sometimes have to call them a few times to get updates.

Still, despite these inconveniences, I keep coming back to IKEA because the prices are reasonable, the product range is wide, and the overall shopping process is easy. It’s just that the delivery could definitely be more reliable to match the rest of the experience.",Trustpilot_USA

"Extremely Disappointed with IKEA’s… . Extremely Disappointed with IKEA’s Delivery and Customer Service

I purchased a kitchen from IKEA Munich for €7,000 (paid in cash), with delivery scheduled for 19 September 2025.
On the delivery day, the team said that the tabletop wouldn’t fit in the elevator and refused to carry it up to the 13th floor via the stairs. They took the entire kitchen back with them.

Since then — almost a month later — I’ve called at least four times and visited the store twice. Every time I was told that “someone will call you in 2–3 days,” but no one ever did. I have neither received my kitchen nor a refund.

Meanwhile, I’ve had to spend extra money on food deliveries because I have no working kitchen, and IKEA has shown no sense of urgency or responsibility to resolve the issue.

IKEA’s customer service in Munich has been completely unresponsive and unprofessional. I expected much better communication and support from such a large company.

"Extremely Disappointed with IKEA’s… . Extremely Disappointed with IKEA’s Delivery and Customer Service

I am incredibly frustrated with the experience I’ve had with IKEA’s delivery service and customer support. I paid extra to have furniture delivered on October 3rd to a care home for a vulnerable family member. Not only did the delivery fail without any prior notice via text or email, but I later received a vague message about a rescheduled delivery on October 5th.

After that, I received no communication at all from IKEA. No explanation, no update—nothing. I was completely left in the dark.

This left me in a very difficult situation. I had arranged for a carpenter to assemble the furniture, only to find out nothing was being delivered. I called IKEA customer service at 7 a.m. today to try to resolve the issue and was told the order would arrive between 1 p.m. and 5 p.m. But as the time approached and the tracking status remained unchanged, I called again—only to be hung up on. When my husband tried calling, we were finally informed that no delivery was coming at all.

To make matters worse, we reached out via Facebook and were told we’d have to cancel and reorder everything ourselves. There was no apology, no ownership of the failure, and no offer to refund the extra delivery fee we paid for a specific date. Instead, we were treated as if we were being unreasonable for expecting the service we had paid for.

Meanwhile, my sister—who lives in the care home—has had her belongings left in disarray while waiting for furniture that never arrived. The complete lack of communication, the unhelpful and dismissive customer service, and the impact this has had on our family is deeply upsetting.

IKEA has failed to deliver on its promises in every way, and I will never shop with them again. If you value reliability, customer care, or basic accountability, I strongly advise you to take your business elsewhere.",Trustpilot_USA

"Broken Warranty Promise on Kitchen Door - Extremely Disappointing . I am writing this review out of extreme frustration after a year-long battle with IKEA's technical service over a warranty issue, hoping it will prevent others from the same experience.

In 2023, I moved into an apartment with a brand new, professionally installed IKEA kitchen. The previous owners provided proof that it was sold with the promise of IKEA's standard 10-year warranty.

About a year ago, the integrated dishwasher door's sliding mechanism failed. It no longer closes properly and often swings open during a cycle, creating a flood risk. It's clearly a mechanical fault with the hardware that integrates the appliance into the IKEA cabinet.

For over a year, I have provided IKEA's technical service with videos, photos, and all requested information. Each time, I was told the dishwasher itself only has a 2-year warranty and that I would have to pay a high fee just for a technician to visit and diagnose the problem I've already clearly documented.

This is where IKEA's response fails completely. My issue is not with the dishwasher's appliance warranty; it is with the hardware and sliding mechanism that is part of the IKEA kitchen cabinet, which is supposed to be covered by the 10-year warranty.

Despite providing the original receipt and arguing this point, IKEA refuses to acknowledge its own warranty terms. The attitude is dismissive, and the policy seems arbitrary and unfair, especially the suggestion that warranties change based on the country of manufacture.

IKEA trades on its reputation for affordable quality and strong warranties. My experience shows that while prices go up, quality control and customer service are plummeting. To be charged a significant fee just to have a documented defect looked at is unacceptable.

I would not recommend relying on IKEA's warranties. The public promise of ""10 years"" is not being honoured behind the scenes, and customers are left to fight for the service they were promised and paid for.",Trustpilot_USA

Whirlpool did send a technician once, who confirmed the appliance was defective, but no further action was taken. Since then, I’ve been contacting IKEA weekly, only to receive the same copy-pasted response every time, with no real assistance.
Their customer service has been extremely disappointing. I’m left with a non-functional induction appliance that cost over €1,000, and neither a replacement nor a refund has been offered. I have now initiated legal action.
I strongly advise against buying from IKEA Netherlands—their after-sales service is unacceptable.",Trustpilot_USA

"Basically dollar store lamps you assemble . (I accidentally first posted this at IKEA Italy))
I went to the IKEA store in San Francisco for little end table lamps.

Ended up assembling what looked like a cheap dollar store lamp. It looks nothing like the lamp on the box. I hadn’t been to IKEA for many years because I don’t like the psychological labyrinth of how they try to extract money when you are simply trying to go to point A from B.

I bought two lamps the other one is still in the box because the box got stained otherwise I would’ve returned it and they make you do your own self check out as the clerks stand on your back to make sure you don’t steal anything yes a real warm shopping experience.

But why bother standing on our backs? You are also surveyed as you were checking out your own stuff because they have a camera on the POS.

It took 3 weeks—and daily calls in the last week—to get this done. I even missed a day of work waiting for their scheduled pickup, but no one showed. The hotline had 30–40 minute wait times, and no one ever knew anything. When I called the pickup company, they blamed IKEA and their system for messing up the times. I called again the next day—same story. They claimed they didn’t have access to the system to see what went wrong. In the end - they never showed up and I got stuck with it.

"Ikea MATÄLSKARE Built-in Microwave . I purchased the Ikea MATÄLSKARE built-in microwave in 2019, expecting a reliable product from a brand that I trusted. Unfortunately, my experience has been extremely disappointing.

In 2023, only a few years after purchase, I noticed bubbles forming inside the microwave’s coating. Since then, the coating has peeled off and now there is severe rust inside the appliance (see attached photos). This is not only unsightly, but also raises serious concerns about safety and hygiene.

I contacted Ikea about this issue, but was told that rust is not covered by warranty – which I find unacceptable. A built-in microwave should last many years without developing rust inside. I have owned several microwaves before, and none of them ever showed this kind of deterioration. Clearly, this points to poor quality materials or a manufacturing defect.

I expected better from Ikea. Selling a product that deteriorates in this way after just a few years is a serious quality issue. For a global company that prides itself on customer satisfaction, dismissing this problem simply because it is outside of the warranty period is disappointing and, frankly, unfair.

I strongly urge Ikea to review this case and take responsibility by offering a repair or replacement. This would demonstrate that Ikea stands behind the quality of its products and respects its customers.

Until then, I cannot recommend the MATÄLSKARE microwave to anyone.",Trustpilot_USA

The TV programs they let run, like ""Masha and the Bear,"" are not suitable for kids. After addressing the staff, I got a theatrical response like no other—they didn’t even want to listen when I asked if we could turn off the TV, as it’s not good for kids. The staff just laughed. The personnel were extremely unfriendly. I asked for an on-site manager, but was told there was none available, and no one bothered to show up despite me purchasing items worth €1,000.

"This review is for IKEA in Stockholm . This review is for IKEA in Stockholm - Barkarby. We bought the ängsjön/backsjön sink and commode to go in the bathroom. We had it installed by a couple of builders / handymen. We had forgotten to pick up the 2nd packet for the ängsjön commode which contained the two drawers. The girl in customer service checked her system and said that there was an even number of these packets in the warehouse, so I wasn't allowed to have one (the customer is always wrong it seems at IKEA!). I then said that I had picked up one from the warehouse and taken it to the cashier, which is why there was probably an even amount - so after that, I got my packet.

However, when I got home and tried to assemble said drawers, the back panel wouldn't slot into the grooves into the side panels as it was a millimetre too thick. So, we filed the grooves and got the panel to fit. After slotting everything in place, the drawers were wonky and it was difficult to remove them as they clip into place on the rails. We had to damage them to get the off and fix the drawers ourselves to be able to get them straight and on the rails properly. The plastic tightening screws meant to hold the plastic plugs in place kept breaking, so I had to order ten of them but it made no difference to how the drawers looked at the start.

The delivery team, however, outright refused to deliver the bed to the second floor.

They lied to my husband, claiming that IKEA does not deliver to the second floor, and said it was their last delivery of the day and that they were “too tired” to complete it. They took advantage of an older man with Parkinson’s who was alone at the time. Instead of following the contract—which clearly stated the bed would be delivered to the room of our choice, the bedroom—they left it in our dining room.

All IKEA offered was a refund for the delivery. That does nothing to fix the fact that we now have a heavy bed blocking our dining room with no way to get it upstairs. This behavior was unfair, dishonest, and completely wrong.

"Better customer care but lower quality . I have always found IKEA a convenient way to buy and explore ideas and sound quality, a value for money. And I loved the opening of the Greenwich store as it meant they're becoming local, and I wouldn't need to go out of my way to visit.
Now, in Glasgow, they're not as convenient, but it isn't too bad. Since I moved, we had to replace a number of pieces of furniture, and we turned to IKEA.
I'm in love with their Stockholm 2025 collection and probably would get one of everything if I could. Since I can't, I looked up to other lines. I appreciate IKEA experimenting with colours but in doing so, they grew the number of items they sell and the price in the way of lowering quality was paid.
Most of the items we got were for delivery and while bother delivery companies provided a good customer service the experience was dampened by the poorer quality of items.
For missing items and easily replaceable I got in touch with the customer service which was easily five stars. Other items where the damage was cosmetic - I can't be bothered because its a pain to deal with with returns and reordering.

This is about the IKEA in Colombia Medellín Envigado, The store very clean very organized but people don’t know a lot about the products, the line to check out took 30 minutes then they made my wait another thirty minutes because they couldn’t find QR code to ring me up. I spent around $5,000 dollars US which is about 20,000,000 pesos dishes cups couch chair rugs and much more. The delivery window was 7am till 7pm? Then they deliver my couch and chair in a box through a third party Company, I was never explained or told I have to assemble or there is a service to do this. So the delivery people who where good said they will put together for a tip so I have no tools and wasn’t explained any of this so I paid them they put together the chair was bent and the sofa was missing the fabric. So I contact IKEA they explain after picture and another hour taking picture and explaining the situation that it is correct the chair is bent and the side is missing the fabric. I already paid the delivery guys to put together. The next delivery was got they drop off the fabric but can’t put on the sofa they deliver the chair and take the broken chair and refuse to put together the second delivery people horrible and rude basically said deal with it not their problem. So now after two weeks and paying for construction I have a sofa that I have to take apart and a chair that I have to put together again and all I get from IKEA is email asking for survey. The price you pay for this furniture is not bad but unreasonable for this region, and then to not explain and not make things right was the only reason I bought from them was for the guarantee to make you at least satisfactory. But they drop and take care of when they want and to imagine you have to take a hole day off from work to wait in this huge window of time to get horrible service is not okay. I feel that for the price you can get better products almost anywhere and for the guarantee you that is not happening here for sure.

Unfortunately, they are far too light. One of the chairs snapped underneath me without warning while I was simply sitting on it, resulting in a serious injury that required a visit to A&E. The experience was both painful and frightening.
I contacted IKEA immediately. While I’ve always been a loyal customer and own many items from their range, I was shocked by their response. I was told that all IKEA products are tested and therefore they do not accept responsibility for the failure of the chair. The only offer I received was a £30 voucher and a replacement chair – which, frankly, I would never dare use again.
I’m now seeking legal advice, as this is completely unacceptable. A chair collapsing like this is not a minor fault – it’s a major safety issue. The lack of accountability from IKEA has seriously undermined my trust in the brand.

We began our kitchen renovation journey with IKEA by booking a Pre-Installation Visit for £50 on Wednesday, 21 August 2024. We made the payment and eagerly looked forward to having a clean, modern kitchen. However, things quickly started going wrong.

On 21 October, we were told that our order had been cancelled and rescheduled for 9 November 2024. Shortly after, we were contacted about the worktop, which was reportedly out of stock and thus removed from the order. We agreed to wait for the new item.

By December, most of the kitchen units arrived—but again, we were informed that the worktop was still out of stock, so we had to continue waiting. Excited to get started, we removed the old kitchen and completed all the interior work—electrical, flooring, painting, and wall repairs.

After numerous phone calls and emails, IKEA’s contracted installation company finally came to begin assembling the kitchen. During the installation, it was discovered that many pieces were missing, and over 80 parts delivered were not related to our kitchen at all.

IKEA called and asked me to reorder the missing parts myself—otherwise, I’d have to wait even longer for a refund. Given that we had started this process back in August and it was now January, I placed the orders immediately just to move things forward. In the meantime, my garage was overflowing with incorrect and unused IKEA parts.

I called IKEA Help Line nearly every day, explaining the situation and requesting that the excess items be collected. Meanwhile, the hob arrived damaged, and the installer requested a replacement. We waited again—for the new hob to arrive, and then another two weeks for the old one to be picked up.

But still, no one came to collect the excess kitchen items from the garage. Every customer service agent promised to ""take note"" and ""handle it,"" but nothing changed. Eventually, I was told someone would finally come. I took time off work and waited at home, but no one showed up. I contacted IKEA again—they gave me another date, which I confirmed multiple times by email—but yet again, no one came.

After another call, a helpful customer service agent manually recorded the full list of extra items. By this point, it had taken three months, but the extra items were finally collected.

In March 2025, the long-awaited worktop arrived and was installed. But just a week later, the wall panel installer discovered a manufacturing defect in the worktop—it had to be reordered. We were devastated. On 10 April 2025, we were informed that the worktop had been cancelled again due to another issue. It finally arrived at the end of June and was installed.

By early July, we were told the wall panels would be fitted. We finally felt that the end was in sight after almost a full year of dealing with this chaos. The installer came and installed the wall panels in the second week of July, only to find that one panel was cut incorrectly—4 inches instead of 5. Another form had to be filled, and we were told it would take six more weeks.

At this point, we have no words left. We chose IKEA believing in their reputation as a professional and reliable company, but our experience has been nothing short of exhausting and deeply disappointing.

We are seriously considering never shopping at IKEA again, and we are sharing our experience here to help others avoid the same fate. If you are thinking of ordering a kitchen from IKEA—please think twice.",Trustpilot_USA

There has been no thorough communication over an email or a follow through from an actual person when the delivery can't be fulfilled and all we received was a text message that the ""order is delayed"" without any further explanation of how long it's delayed and why it's delayed shows negligence and lousy customer service. After so many ping ponging between departments and customer representatives who all sounded so careless and reluctant to resolve our case we found out our best option is to cancel our order. Never thought Ikea customer service would be this unprofessional and disorganized. After a month and so of waiting and living without a kitchen, we canceled our entire order and we'll never do renovation business with Ikea ever again.

Got home and there’s missing parts so could not install rang up the following morning and was told they could post out missing parts between 3-5 days. I said no if it’s not next day.
I asked for replacement which all information was requested again and given to IKEA CS who told me it’s booked for exchange Thursday 14th July. Called again morning of to get delivery time, was told the exchange was not booked. She will do it for me to receive on Friday 15 July received a text saying delivery will is between 11am-3pm.

Waited n waited then call ikea CS enquiring about delivery. While on the call a missed call from a number told the Ikea CS that may b driver as I don’t recognise number. The driver hung up. I called back the missed call number 4 times before the driver answered by this time it’s now 3:40. I asked the driver where he was he said 40 mins away. I said my delivery was booked 11-3pm. He said he’s just the driver. I said do what as he haven’t called it texted to say he was running late or nothing. He hung up.
I rang back 40 mins later which is now past 16:30 no answer. Rang back Ikea CS and was told the driver could not contact customer. He said he will contact the store and get back to me. Received a text ikea that the driver said I was rude.
Can’t do anything so called back Monday morning way again assured it will be delivered Tuesday 15 July still nothing.

I explained it wasn’t possible and was told there best solution was for them to collect. I asked who was liable for the collection fee and they said it was them as they couldn’t get someone to assemble the item. The item has now been collected and I have been offered £ 75 credit at there store plus a bank refund of £46 for non assembly. When I queried why I had been deducted £80 I was told it was because I only returned one box not the two delivered. I advised this was incorrect and a week later they changed the story to say it was because the second box was damaged.

During my session, I was connected with an associate who, from the start, appeared disinterested and disengaged based on her tone and demeanor. Despite this, I proceeded to share the dimensions of my closet and the existing IKEA PAX pieces I currently own. When she asked what products I wanted in the closet, I explained that I love the large PAX systems I already have and was hoping to rely on her expertise to help complete the remaining layout. At that point, she became noticeably quiet and then unexpectedly disconnected from the call. There was no follow-up or attempt to reconnect, and I strongly feel this was done intentionally. This experience was frustrating and unprofessional, especially from a brand that prides itself on customer experience and home design support.

"No customer respect . A replacement kitchen faucet was installed under warranty by Helsingin LVI-Huolto, arranged by IKEA. During the installation, clear plumbing faults were either missed or ignored: the overflow pipe was improperly connected, and one branch of the trap was sealed with tape — both clear violations of plumbing standards and a potential leakage risk.

I expected professional diligence: if faults are visible, the customer should be informed — or the faucet should not be connected until the issue is resolved. That didn’t happen.

When the issue came to light later, both IKEA and the plumbing company distanced themselves. They stated that if the fault had been noticed, I would’ve been responsible for the repair costs — yet they simultaneously claimed there was no fault to begin with. That contradiction was never addressed, and no one accepted responsibility, even though both oversight and execution were in their hands.

This experience wasn’t just about a faucet — it was about how companies behave when something goes wrong. I cannot recommend either party if you expect to be treated fairly and professionally when problems arise.",Trustpilot_USA

"Why you should not trust Ikea's assembly service or ikea support . I got a single standing Pax Wardrope and an assembly service from ikea. The new wardrobe was attached to my old wardrope with screws without my permission and apart from that the assembly service made a hole in the middle of the side panel. I contacted ikea 5 june and today I received an update that it was my mistake that I have disassembled the wardrope myself and the damage occurred. This was unbelievable support as I have not dissassabled the wardrope, I simply wanted to move it to another location since I was not aware the wardropes are attached together then I realized the sticking screws and that the wardropes were attached together. I also contacted the assembly service and their insurance argues that this was how the wardrope was meant to build. So I guess if you buy a new wardrobe from ikea and an assembly service, they will attach your new wardrobe to another wardrope they find nearby. It is totally unbelievable what I am dealing with and I do not recommend anyone to get ikea's assembly service or even the pax wardrope.The support they provide is beyond terrible where you are left with explaining what happened over and over with detailed pictures but they still don't understand come back with an irrelevant reply and if possible I would give zero stars.
Seconly Ikea suggests an assembly service and you think that if you get this you can trust it more but that is not the case. When something goes wrong ikea simply says that the assembly service has nothing to do with them. I could have paid for an assembly service for half the price to another company and not have these damages. Plus the frustration.
My order number is :#1519822143
There is also a case ID: 23688377
my ikea design code: V9VRZN (which can be seen as clearly a single standing one wardrope)

My experience was that IKEA, their assembly service and the assembly service insurance are doing their best not to acknowledge what happened and help.

They charge £35.00 upwards for delivery of larger items ie cupboards whereas Argos and other brands charge much less.

Speaking of rabbits, their staff look like rabbits in headlights and should you have the audacity to aproach them to ask them for help and if they don't manage to dodge you then they just look uninterested and annoyed.
Their food is basically cheap hotdogs and other rubbish.

"Wow majorly disappointed! . Wow. Where do I even begin to sing the praises of Assembly Services Australia? I mean, if you're looking for an elite-level ghosting experience paired with a masterclass in last-minute disappointment—look no further!

So I ordered a $1200 IKEA unit (because adulting), and IKEA generously handed the assembly over to these champions of communication. Monday 30th June rolls around and—surprise!—nothing but radio silence. My calls? Straight to voicemail. The magical link they sent for updates? Ignored with the grace of a seasoned illusionist. No show, no heads-up, just the soft hum of shattered expectations.

But wait—it gets better! Late afternoon, someone finally awakens from their nap to let me know the assembler is gasp sick. Tragic. Can they come Tuesday instead? Sure, I’ll just reschedule my entire existence, no biggie. I ask (again) for a post-9am time so I can get my daughter to school and, you know, not leave a stranger unsupervised in my child’s room. Wild concept.

But Assembly Services Australia, ever the innovator, hits me with a 6pm message saying they'll arrive between 7am and 7:30am. Because clearly, they operate in a parallel universe where “after 9am” translates to “at the crack of dawn.” I politely (read: exasperatedly) decline, and they respond with the pièce de résistance: “Well you’ll have to reschedule.”

"Unable to have refund issue after 29 days . Ikea in Orlando

I placed a large order with Ikea in Orlando for home office furniture on April 18th, 2025. All the items arrived damaged, and some did not get delivered, even though it showed that I signed for them, and I did not. Apparently the delivery driver decided to sign for the order himself even tough I was in front of him and I could had signed if asked to. This is questionable and unethical and leads to fraud on their part as it was evident by the missing item that showed delivered.

Ikea replaced the damaged items and the one that was never delivered as well, but some of the replacements were severely damaged for a second time.

In particular, a bookcase was replaced multiple times, and the last delivery was the worst of all. This bookcase showed signs that the wood had been repaired with wood filler to cover holes and damages. This unit is in used condition and not a new unit, which is what I paid for. Also this bookcase has holes drilled in places were no holes were supposed to be

I asked IKEA to replace the damaged parts to avoid having to return the entire unit. After Ikea agreed to do this, they never sent the replacements and then told me that they would not ship such large pieces. This action was and is still questionable as in fact, Ikea shipped larger pieces to my home, such as the bookcase in question and several office desks, so why not the replacement parts ? This further delayed the completion of my office space.

Having been dealing with this now for 6 weeks, I decided just to return the bookcase. The bookcase was picked up on June 2nd, 2025, and the IKEA driver that picked up the unit confirmed that IKEA received the unit and had it in their possession the next day, June 3rd, 2025.

As of today it has been extremely frustrating that Ikea has had my return for 21 days and I have yet to get my refund.

Every time I contact customer service, I get the same response that my return is being processed. It was also noted by me that when Ikea does not like responses you give to them in writing, they do not send you a copy of your online chat with customer service. This has happened multiple times including today June 24th 2025. For this reason I was proactive, and I made copies of these chats in plain text form before I exited the system.

It is obvious that Ikea is trying to cover their wrongdoing by not allowing consumers access to their transcripts that shows proof of their actions or lack off. I am attaching copies of this transcript that shows Ikea's refusal to refund my money in a timely manner after having their return for 21 days.

As of now June 24th no refund has been issued yet. As usual their customer service stated that they raised the issue again.

I reported this to IKEA the very next day. They said they would order the missing parts and deliver them to our new address was taken for delivery updates.

After two weeks of silence, I received a message from Royal Mail with a tracking link, but the link didn’t work. I couldn’t track the item or even adjust the delivery options (e.g., leave at rear door), which was important because we weren’t home during delivery hours. The tracking number turned out to be a DHL number, because the parts were coming from Slovakia. It only shows progress until the UK, and after that – no visibility at all.

Then I got a message saying the item was “delivered” – but nothing arrived. It wasn’t at the door, not with neighbours, not anywhere around the property.

I called Royal Mail four times, and they told me to contact IKEA, as they couldn't help.
I called IKEA five times, visited the Cardiff store four times, and even emailed and messaged. No one responded. IKEA staff told me they can’t provide tracking numbers for missing parts orders – which is unbelievable.

Even the smallest online businesses give proper tracking numbers and delivery info. IKEA, a global company, can’t even manage that.

Now I’m stuck with a huge sofa box sitting in my living room for over two weeks. I can’t assemble it, I can’t use it, and I can’t return it. I paid for a man with a van to transport it – if I tried to return it now, I’d have to hire another van and lose even more money. At this point, even a refund is costing me.

If the parts are reordered, I’ll likely face the same delivery issues, with no tracking and more delays. So I’m asking:
Come and collect this item from my home and give me a refund, so I can purchase a different product that I can actually use.

This has been one of the worst customer experiences I’ve had with any company.",Trustpilot_USA

"delivery . This was the most terrible shopping and delivery experience I’ve had during my entire time in Egypt. An entire day was wasted waiting for an IKEA delivery. In the 21st century, this is simply absurd: no tracking system, no order status updates, no accountability whatsoever.

From 8:00 AM to 8:30 PM, I couldn’t leave the house — stuck the entire day waiting for the order to arrive. That’s over 12 hours of my time wasted, with zero information or certainty about anything.

At 3:00 PM, I got a call saying the driver was on the way. In reality, he arrived only at 8:30 PM — five and a half hours later. I had no idea if they were even going to show up.

The driver didn’t speak a single word of English, so it was impossible to communicate. IKEA’s customer support was completely useless — no clear answers, no help, no apology.

To make matters worse, the online account system doesn’t work at all. There is no information about my order in my account — nothing. I made a prepayment, yet I’m completely deprived of any updates or order status. The only thing I received was a single confirmation email, and that’s it.

Order number: WEBO0709543

How can a global brand allow itself to treat customers with such disregard? This wasn’t just a delay — it was a complete lack of service and basic respect.

Extremely disappointed. I have no desire to order from IKEA Egypt again. If you can’t manage a simple delivery — you’re going to lose customers.

I request that this complaint be escalated to IKEA global quality management. The local IKEA Egypt service is completely unacceptable.",Trustpilot_USA

Good luck calling their so-called “customer service” — it’s a joke. Prepare for a ride through arrogance, discrimination, flat-out racism, and people who seem professionally trained in being useless.

IKEA doesn’t respect customers — they exploit them. Their entire sales pitch is a scripted lie. Once they’ve pocketed your money, you’re dead to them. It’s been nearly a year of chasing these clowns for a resolution. Now they’ve moved on to cutting calls mid-conversation. It’s not just bad service — it’s fraud dressed up as a global brand.

On top of that they refused to allow me to make a complaint and said even if I did they don't resolve complaints for customers as a matter of policy, and they simply get resolved internally and nothing would be done to make things right for the customer in any way shape or form.

All this time we had no way to cook food as we didn't have an oven and had to keep taking everything to the laundry, and there are three of us. We also had to physically go to the shop four times as getting through on the phone eas way too time consuming. So, not cheap!

They let me know that customer service email is no longer in use so phone lines will be even more clogged up with people having to call. In the email, they said they'd get back to me soon.

"IKEA . IKEA, What Happened to You?

I’m writing this as a long-time IKEA customer who used to love your brand—but after my most recent experience, I can confidently say I’ll never buy from IKEA again.

I ordered a full PAX closet system and was hit with delay after delay. I kept receiving texts and emails telling me to “reschedule” using a provided link—except the reschedule link was disabled. Completely useless. No explanation, no workaround, no follow-up.
So I tried calling. Big mistake. The customer service call wait time? 45 minutes or more. One of your texts even asked me to call you—so I did, and I waited nearly an hour (!). After a few minutes on the call, your agent’s headset died or disconnected, and no one ever bothered to call me back.

There’s no clear support process, no accountability, and absolutely no respect for your customers’ time.
I expected better from IKEA. I genuinely thought you were above this. But in truth, Walmart now offers far better customer service than IKEA, and that’s saying a lot.

This purchase has been a total regret. From what used to be my favorite store, IKEA has now dropped to the bottom of the list. After this closet system debacle, I will never buy another product from IKEA again.

"DELIVERY DOESNT TAKE PLACE . Paid almost 100 euros for delivery, scheduled for a specific date. I take time off from work for the date, and delivery doesn't arrive. IKEA tells me to wait more, there may be traffic, and then when I push them to check with the delivery company then it turns out the products were not prepared for pickup by IKEA therefore delivery company didn't pick it up. Then delivery is rescheduled for one week later, I have to take another day off from work (already hundreds of Euros damages) and IKEA only offers me 20 euro discount card for next purchase.. And the scheduled second delivery AGAIN is changed to another date by IKEA with no notification, I see it on the delivery company's website...

"EXTREME frustration with the handling of warranty claim . Over the past four weeks, I have been caught in an endless cycle of referrals, repeated requests for information, and unfulfilled promises of assistance. Below is a summary of the issues I have encountered

IKEA NL first refused my claim because I live in Germany, directing me to IKEA Germany, despite having purchased the items in the Netherlands.

IKEA Germany then told me to contact IKEA NL, since the purchase was made in the Netherlands.

Since then, I have repeatedly submitted my receipt number, article number, and the same defect photos—only to be asked for them again.

Representatives promised my case was prioritized and that I would receive a call; no call ever came. When I followed up, I was again told it was a priority.

Most recently, IKEA NL asked me once more for photos I had already provided.

I never expected IKEA’s service to be this poor. Initially, I only wanted replacements; now I refuse further dealings with IKEA and demand a full refund.

I have now contacted the Dutch consumer protection agency.",Trustpilot_USA

"ikea gives zero shirts . I am leaving my letter here because you dont bother to check your inbox. Dear IKEA Customer Service,
I am writing to express my deep dissatisfaction with your continued failure to fulfill orders reliably to Madeira Island. The below order has just been cancelled as it never got delivered as promised.
I have placed multiple orders with IKEA over the past few years, and every single one has had some form of delivery issue. In February of this year, I received a letter from IKEA acknowledging these repeated failures, along with a small gift and a written guarantee that such problems would not happen again. Based on this assurance, I decided to give IKEA another chance and placed a new order.
That order was due to arrive today — two months after it was placed. I received no proactive communication from IKEA indicating there would be any delay. When I followed up myself, I was told that the shipment only departed on May 26, and that I would now need to wait indefinitely, with no delivery date or timeline available. This is unacceptable. I was relying on this order and have now had to cancel it due to the continued uncertainty.
After months of patience, I am left incredibly disappointed. IKEA’s previous promise has been broken, and I’ve been left with no products, no clarity, and wasted time.
At this point, I see only two fair options going forward:
IKEA provides me with a voucher to be used toward an alternative delivery method (not collection), as a gesture of goodwill and compensation for the two months I spent waiting for an order that never arrived.
OR
I will walk away from IKEA permanently and take my business elsewhere. I will no longer support a company that does not follow through on its basic promise: to deliver the goods I paid for.
I look forward to your response and hope IKEA will make good on its commitment to improving the experience for customers in Madeira.
Sincerely,

alex",Trustpilot_USA

"I recently used IKEA’s Wardrobe… . I recently used IKEA’s Wardrobe Planning - At Home service, expecting a professional and seamless experience. Initially, everything went well—the planner provided a good layout, and I even decided to add a vanity table, bringing the total to around £1,500.

However, the execution was shockingly poor. The representative who visited did not measure properly, resulting in a major flaw: the total length of the furniture exceeds the space, and now one of our doors cannot open fully. This kind of oversight is unacceptable, especially coming from a brand like IKEA that promotes convenience and smart design.

After lengthy discussions, I was offered a £200 refund. Frankly, this feels inadequate considering the scale of the issue. This isn’t just a minor purchase—it’s a wardrobe setup meant to last for years.

To make matters worse, two essential parts are missing. Despite repeated requests, I’ve been told they are out of stock and have been for months. I’m left with an incomplete setup and no clear resolution.

This experience has left me extremely disappointed. I expected better from IKEA, especially after paying for a dedicated planning service.

This isn’t just about the kitchen. I’ve also had issues with damaged shelves, as they were packed and delivered in flimsy, transparent plastic wrap instead of proper packaging.

I expected much better quality and service based on my positive experiences with IKEA in other countries. But, as IKEA Italia would say, ""That’s life."" If you want to deal with damaged furniture and no accountability for the products and services they sell, choose IKEA. I can't recommend them for any purchase, big or small.

IKEA Italia doesn’t allow customers to leave honest reviews for their products. It seems they only post positive feedback, as they filter out all negative reviews. I’ve submitted multiple reviews, but none have been posted. It seems like they only allow positive feedback. IKEA Italia should be EU-regulated, but it acts as though it's not, with almost nonexistent consumer protection.",Trustpilot_USA
"Poor Customer Service and Warranty Handling – IKEA HYLLESTAD Mattress . I am deeply disappointed with how IKEA has handled my warranty claim regarding the HYLLESTAD mattress. After encountering the same defect in four separate mattresses, it's clear this is not a case of “normal wear and tear,” as IKEA support claims, but rather a recurring manufacturing issue. Despite providing all required evidence—including detailed photos and descriptions—I received only generic, dismissive responses, no meaningful resolution, and now complete radio silence after my last follow-up.

What’s especially frustrating is the inconsistency in IKEA’s assessments. Previous claims for the exact same defect were accepted based on a single photo and a brief explanation, with the claim approved within minutes. Yet my current claim was rejected without any proper justification. To make matters worse, multiple case numbers were unnecessarily opened for the same issue, adding confusion and delays to an already frustrating process.

It is entirely unreasonable to expect customers to transport defective mattresses back to a store for reassessment after failing to address the issue remotely. This shows a clear lack of respect for customers’ time, effort, and loyalty.

IKEA, this is not how you treat customers who trust your brand and your so-called warranty policy.

I placed an order with IKEA. A month later the items never arrived, and I wasn’t even contacted. I had to chase them myself, only to be told the items had gone missing. So I went out of my way to collect the items in person.

When I finally got everything home, one of the parts was faulty. I now have to drive all the way back again just to replace something that should have been checked before it ever left the warehouse.

The level of incompetence and lack of care I’ve experienced from IKEA is genuinely shocking. I’ve spent my own time, energy, and fuel fixing their mistakes.

The whole thing has been a joke from start to finish. I’m shocked at how badly it’s been handled.",Trustpilot_USA

"What a horrible first time experience... . This was my first time shopping with IKEA online and it will definitely be my last, both online and in-store. I placed an order for a full desk setup. Everything went through. I received an order confirmation, an order number, and the money left my bank account. Hours later, around 1:00 AM my time, I got an email saying my paid order was cancelled. I checked my bank account the next morning after waking up and seeing the email and saw the transaction was pending, which is normal for most transactions with my bank.

I contacted customer service through the app. They apologized and said it was cancelled because the payment was declined. That made no sense because a declined payment does not pull money. Then they said a refund would be processed. A refund on a declined transaction does not even make sense. They told me the money should come back within 24 hours. I ended the chat and decided to call instead.

The second representative told me the same thing. They said the payment was declined and not to worry because my money would be back any minute. Meanwhile, I had already scheduled pickup for a specific day. I live 5 hours from the nearest IKEA and 2.5 hours from the pickup point. I took the day off work, paid a sitter for an extra day and sold my old desk to make room for the new setup I was to pick up in a few days. They proceeded to send me a link to and invoice to pay again once the refund came through.

Ten hours later, I checked my bank account to see if it had returned and lo and behold the payment was no longer pending and had fully cleared! I called my bank, and they confirmed that IKEA accepted the payment and that no refund was pending.

I reached out to IKEA for a third time, now furious. The third representative said they saw the payment was accepted, but that something happened and it got marked as declined and cancelled at some point hours later. Then I was told I have to wait 7 to 14 business days for a refund my almost $300 order. Complete opposite of what I was told twice prior today!

So now I am sitting here with no desk, out a day’s pay, babysitting costs, and no idea WHEN or IF I will get my money back or the items I have paid for. And at this point I cannot even reorder because the the pick up dates change every day and I will have lost out on my original date and the one time shipping fee is higher than my monthly car insurance. I now have to wait up to 48 more before they decide if they’ll approve or decline fixing their own mistake.

All I wanted was a cute IKEA desk and instead this experience has been deeply frustrating and unacceptable for a company of IKEA’s size and reputation.",Trustpilot_USA

"Ikea furniture ok, support horrible . Let me start with Ikea furniture and items are ok and average, but a little pricey for having to spend hours assembling them. Given that the furniture and products are 4-star. But the customer support is the worst. First of all, you can't email them and can only call and wait and long hold time, or CHAT online. I ordered a dresser online and had it shipped to my house and a reasonable cost and time. When I received the box a couple of items were bent and damaged. I put together pretty much the entire dresser including using the damaged parts. I've contacted customer support via phone and CHAT online several times and all those times were promised to receive the damaged part within a couple weeks. After over two months and numerous times contacting them, I still have not received any communications, updates or the part.

"IKEA Germany: A Nightmare of Service and Total Disrespect . IKEA Germany has redefined what it means to have terrible customer service.

I placed an order, expecting delivery on the morning of April 15th. What followed was an absolute disaster. The delivery didn’t show up, and I wasted the entire day waiting. When I contacted customer service, I was promised it would “definitely” arrive by the end of the day. That was a complete lie.

The next day, I had to open a case, and I was told they needed 48 hours to “investigate.” After waiting 24 hours with no updates, I had to fight just to get a new delivery scheduled. IKEA did not take any initiative on their own — I had to push them every step of the way. Then, when the new delivery was finally set, I received a call from the delivery company saying they couldn’t deliver. At this point, I had already waited 48 hours and no one at IKEA seemed to care.

What happened next is the real kicker: while I was waiting for an update on delivery and made it clear I couldn’t wait any longer, I was surprised with a cancellation of my order — without asking for it, without notifying me in advance, and without any explanation. This was done without my consent, and I was left completely in the dark.

After all this, IKEA refunded me the full amount, which, frankly, was the least they could do. But then, instead of giving me my money back in a usable form, IKEA gave me a store voucher — something I didn’t ask for and definitely didn’t need.

On top of everything, I couldn’t help but feel that my name, which is clearly not German, played a role in how I was treated. The lack of communication, the utter disregard for customer needs, and the inability to resolve simple issues felt personal. I was ignored and dismissed — and I wonder if it’s because they saw me as someone not worth the effort.

IKEA has left me without furniture, drained my time, and made me feel unimportant. This is hands down the worst customer service experience I have ever had. If you want reliable service, don’t even consider IKEA — their incompetence is truly unmatched.",Trustpilot_USA

"IKEA kitchens discontinued, no replacement parts, and zero customer service . IKEA kitchens might look great at first, but beware: they don’t stand by them.

This is the second IKEA kitchen I’ve bought that has been discontinued (first Bodarp, now this one). When parts break — even under warranty — replacements aren’t available. I was told some items would be sent, but they never arrived. I have a further door that’s damaged that they can’t replace (owing to no stock), and cover panels that have become brittle and are in real need of replacement. I would request a new one if customer service would only engage with me.

I’ve sent at least five emails to customer service — including one specifically asking for a complaint to be raised — and have received no response. When I try to call, I’m left on hold for over 30 minutes, only to get nowhere.

Would not recommend, or at least disregard the smaller pair when choosing over another option. Also, the outer edges (i.e. not the cutting edges) of both pairs are also quite sharp, meaning it's easy to accidentally cut yourself if pressing firmly on the outside! Be warned!

"Never again IKEA Canada or Taskrabbit . IKEA does not have a dedicated team of installers. They use task rabbit which is the absolutely worst company. One of their installers drilled holes to anchor the bookcases drilling into the adjacent room, breaking the plaster and now the nails are sticking out of the wall. The installation of the bookcases was not done correctly with a one inch gap between the bookcase shelf and the cupboard door. IKEA then refers you back to Task rabbit to fix these errors where I was on hold for 15 minutes before someone answered whose English was unintelligible. To send someone to paint, plaster and repair the wall they would “credit” me for 2 hours but I would pay the difference. For this installation I paid 355$ and the repair of the wall will probably be over $500. Never ever buy from Ikea or deal with Task rabbit!!!",Trustpilot_USA
"Poor Staff Attitude . I made my first visit to IKEA today. To say I was disappointed is a huge understatement. My intention was to buy two Kallax units for my kitchen. Unfortunately one of the units I wanted was out of stock and was not due back in until very late March. Your store assistant Julia couldn't have been more helpful in searching for the items I wanted. I ended up choosing similar items rather than have to make the long journey from NE Fife again. I am severely disabled and Julia and another customer helped me get the items I needed into the trolley and showed me where customer services was as I would need help to get these items into my car. I got to the checkout and there were lots of customers queuing. I joined a queue and waited. After a couple of minutes, an elderly female assistant told me that the checkout was closing and to join another checkout. I joined the queue adjacent to the one I had been in and continued to wait. A minute or two later, the same assistant reappeared and told me that this checkout was closing as well. During the time I had been waiting in these two queues, several other customers had joined the only other queue ahead of me. I waited for ten minutes or so, and the queue never progressed, and no other checkouts were opened to speed things up. I was in pain, as I always am, and decided that I could not tolerate this any longer and abandoned my trolley and left the store. As I left, the assistant who had told me to move to different checkouts saw me and scowled, as she would be well aware that I had given up. The end result was that I didn't get the items I had travelled a long way to purchase, and your company lost a £100 sale. Not a great introduction to Ikea for me.

I set about making a complaint when I got home. The chat assistant on the IKEA website informed me that IKEA do not respond to customers complaints and deal with everything ""internally"". That system effectively allows IKEA to simply ignore your complaint if they so wish, and strikes me as pretty poor business practice. I won't be back.",Trustpilot_USA

"5 Months of Delays, Broken Promises, and Terrible Customer Service . We spent £5,000 on a kitchen from IKEA London, expecting delivery on December 13, 2024. To prepare, we removed our old kitchen before this date. However, IKEA failed to deliver and did not even inform us.

After calling customer service multiple times, we were told that 6 cabinet doors were out of stock, so they decided to hold back the entire order without informing us. We were forced to reorder, and IKEA rescheduled partial delivery for January 3, 2025.

🔴 When the delivery finally arrived:

Two cabinets were missing, despite being on the order.

Two additional cabinets were never ordered by IKEA’s sales staff, forcing us to reorder and wait even longer.

The cover panels, originally promised to arrive in November, were delayed until the end of February.

This caused serious financial losses:

We had no kitchen for months, forcing us to order takeaway daily, costing us hundreds of pounds.

Workers we hired had to be rescheduled multiple times, wasting both time and money.

Our home was left in complete chaos due to missing parts.

🔴 Customer Service is Appalling:

IKEA’s customer service repeatedly promised to call us back, but they NEVER did.

In-store staff assured us the cover panels would be free as compensation—later, they backtracked and said only the delivery fee would be free.

IKEA initially offered £200 in vouchers for compensation, then raised it to £300, but now they are backtracking again and are unsure if they will even offer that!

We repeatedly requested written confirmation of compensation offers, but IKEA refused and kept making verbal promises they later withdrew.

After 5 months, our order is finally complete, but we still have not received any fair compensation for all the stress, inconvenience, and financial loss we suffered.

IKEA needs to take responsibility for their failures!

"What an absolute farce . What an absolute farce. Used ikea to design our new office kitchen and all seemed fine. Paid the invoice on the day of design, and awaited delivery. Delivery arrived and as our joiner started to assemble we realised a key structural part was missing, when we spoke to customer services we were informed that it was not their fault and was in fact ours for not ordering the right parts… at no point did we order anything, the designer did. We had to pay for this extra part that would prevent the unit falling on us, our children or our dogs, and then awaited delivery of the final bit - the worktop. With all of the injuries and deaths caused by IKEA items you’d think they’d want to ensure their staff know how to design a build that won’t cause a 1.4m tall unit to come off of a wall. We got a text that it would be here by 1pm, then 4pm, then 8pm. When we rang customer services for an update we were told it was on a van that was on a route so far from our address there was no feasible way it could make it to us. No one had any idea where it was, when it could get here. Still waiting. There was one item that was out of stock, and we were assured that as we had paid for it we would receive it as soon as it was back, it’s been back in stock for 3 weeks online and we are told that their system won’t let them dispatch it to us. Whilst the kitchen itself is nice, the service, delivery and overall performance of IKEA has been shocking. No one wants to take accountability or is willing to even try and resolve. Arrogant and rude staff both in store and online. £4,000 and not a single bit of good customer service.

"Kitchen Planning . Kitchen Planning: An Absolute Disaster

I have been waiting for six weeks now for a response or any kind of contact from IKEA. The kitchen was left half-installed. Beforehand, I repeatedly asked whether the installation included the stovetop – I was assured that it did. That’s why I bought it from IKEA instead of purchasing it from another manufacturer. However, during installation, I was suddenly told that the connection would not be made.
• The cabinets are too high; I can’t reach the shelves.
• The sink was neither installed nor connected, and the stove is also not connected.
• My black kitchen was fitted with a white cabinet frame because the black one was unavailable.
• Half of the tall cabinets are still missing and are not in stock.

Mistakes can happen – but what matters is how a company handles problems. Unfortunately, IKEA doesn’t seem to care much, as no one has contacted me so far. And this is despite the fact that everything has already been paid for in full (no installment payments!). €5,000 for a small kitchen without appliances – and yet, a nightmare.

Since January, I have been washing my dishes in the bathtub.

"IKEA & Task Rabbit - what a shit show. . We were told by IKEA that two people would be attending to complete the wardrobe build. Only one person showed. He took 10 and half hours and had no break! Surely that’s illegal. I felt so sorry for the guy. It’s an absolute shit show what Task Rabbit and IKEA are running here. The guy had no brief or foresight what he was going to be building and how long it was going to take. Where’s your Health and Safety and Wellbeing Management? My partner and I had to cancel our anniversary plans, dinner and tickets for a show cancelled because the guy could not complete the build in the 5 hours we were told by IKEA. He was on his own. I called IKEA complaints department and all they could offer me was £70 in store voucher. What an absolute insult. I spent £1300 on these wardrobes and the extra costs of cancelled dinner charges and tickets have left me even more out of pocket for their mistake.
Why would I want to spend more money in this shit show of a shop? Shocking.",Trustpilot_USA
"Ikea Kitchens - AVOID!!!!!! . I had my kitchen consultation in Aug 2024 and arranged for it to be installed in Nov 2024. My experience has been like a comedy except it's not funny! 2 weeks after the consultation I changed my wall panels to stainless steel which sounds straight forward but I had to numerous times to make sure this was done. I was then told the kitchen would be fitted but the worktops would not, so I would need to have temporary worktops until they arrived, which I agreed to. First I had a partial kitchen delivered. I took time off of work for the delivery and nothing arrived. Then I had 2 kitchens delivered. 2 x 126 boxes but on various dates but some things were not delivered at all. I had endless phone calls with Ikea trying to sort this out. The fitters then arrived 2 days late (at least they did inform me) and logged everything we had double's of and order the other things that were missing. They did a good job and promised to return when the worktops arrived. Ikea said this would be in December. In the meantime I had another whole kitchen delivery in my living room that Ikea didn't seem to want to collect. Customer service kept asking me why I'd ordered 2 kitchens. They couldn't seem to understand that I didn't and it was their error. It took another round of endless calls for them to collect the kitchen. The installer was also trying for me.
It was finally collected at 8.30pm nearly 3 weeks later (not the time they said so luckily I was home) so I was just waiting for my worktops with an under mount sink. The dates again changed from December to January. (I again took another day off of work in Jan for them to not be delivered) the dates changed again to 22 Feb then 24 Feb 2025 and now they have finally been delivered but without the sink attached. The installer asked Ikea for what was happening and surprisingly Ikea called me. They said they would send a new sink in time for the installers to put in which was 10th March 2025. I then received an email confirming the sink but it was the wrong one. The installers can no longer fit the worktops on 10th March and I have no idea when the correct sink is coming.
I have a very busy job and have to keep taking time out to call Ikea. You can't get straight through, a lot of the time you wait 30 minutes before going through the whole story again. It's ruined the pleasure of getting a new kitchen. One department doesn't speak to another. They promise to look into it and come back to you but nothing happens and you have to call back again. No one takes responsibility. You speak to a different person each time and there are 50 of them. They will not put you through to a manager and do not answer emails. I have honestly run out of patience and am putting this all over social media in the hope that Ikea contact me to sort this out. I would love to cancel my order but am trapped into it. I now have to make time to call them again tomorrow to sort out the sink. I honestly don't know how any one gets their kitchens finished. Horrendous. Just avoid using them. They're too big and no-ones cares. I've had non stop stress and frustration. Do not recommend!!",Trustpilot_USA
"IKEA Works With Terrible Delivery Companies . As I had a recent back injury I opted for the delivery to floor for my KIVIK sofa which was an extra service. When the delivery people came, they took the boxes out of the truck carried two small packages to the floor and left the third big one on the ground level. Prior to my order I did the necessary measurements and I was 100% sure all of the pieces would easily fit in, that's why I ordered it. The delivery people didn't even try to fit it in. They just left and said it won't it in. I tried to tell them I did the measurements and I was sure it would fit they said they have a lot of experience and they do not need to try it. Because the box was blocking the entrance of both my apartment and my downstairs neighbor we had to take it up ourselves. Contrary to what the delivery people claimed, the box did fit and it was possible to move it to my floor without taking apart, and I have photos proving this. Now because of this incident, my back injury which was already bad is worse and I can't kneel. I am furious about the quality of service I received. I wouldn't have ordered from Ikea if there wasn't delivery to floor.",Trustpilot_USA

"Missing Spares, Non show up Services etc. . I ordered wardrobes from IKEA (Order Number:9900146007000136180125) and arranged assembly on 01.02 through TaskRabbit. Unfortunately, the wardrobe lights were missing from my delivery, and as a result, they could not be assembled when the wardrobes were being put together. Since the lights were missing from the order, their assembly could not take place as planned.

I contacted IKEA support multiple times via chat, only to be repeatedly informed that the lights were unavailable for home delivery. Left with no alternative, I had to visit an IKEA store—the only location where the lights were available. This store was far from both my home and the city center, requiring a journey of more than an hour with multiple public transport connections, making the pickup highly inconvenient.

While communicating via chat, I was assured that the light assembly appointment was scheduled for , Friday, 21.02. The attached document confirms this. I was informed that I would receive a call before the technician arrived. However, no one showed up, and I did not receive any phone call.

I do not accept the excuse that the assembly service is a third-party service. As IKEA, you arranged the service, and you should ensure it happens. If not, you should have provided contact details for situations like this. It was not provided whom to contact, where to call, or send an email, and it is still unclear. I called IKEA support, but it was useless as they didn’t know whom to contact either because it is a third-party service. I trusted the service you arranged, and it has been totally disappointing. Please do not use the third-party situation as an excuse.

This entire situation has been extremely frustrating and unacceptable. I have put in significant time and effort to resolve an issue caused by IKEA’s mistake. I have had to:

Reschedule the assembly multiple times,
Stay home for an unreasonably long time (07:00 to 21:00) expecting a call or a technician, I wasted my entire day twice for the assembly.
Spend hours communicating with IKEA chat support, often waiting for availability,
Repeatedly explain the issue, provide details, and attach receipts,
Waste my time picking up an item that should have been delivered to my home in the first place,
Pay for an assembly service that was never completed.",Trustpilot_USA

"Unacceptable Customer Service & Failed Delivery – Extremely Disappointed . I ordered seven shelves and received free home delivery—or so I thought. When the delivery driver arrived, instead of bringing the shelves inside as promised, he dumped them in front of my door without ringing the doorbell and was literally running away before my husband caught him. When we stopped him to ask if that was everything, he casually said, “Yeah” and left. Turns out, we had only received four out of the seven shelves we paid for.

I immediately had to wait an hour on the phone to speak to someone who informed me the missing shelves were out of stock. This was a huge inconvenience because I had scheduled people to assemble them Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, assuming the full order would arrive. Still, I was told they would be back in stock within the next week.

Fast forward to the following Saturday, I had heard nothing. I reached out again and was offered a gift card as compensation—not for the fact that the shelves were missing, but because the delivery was not handled properly.

Then, things got even worse. The shelves were showing as in stock online, so I contacted IKEA again to arrange delivery, only to be told that they could not send them and had no idea when they could. Even though I live three hours away, I was expected to just wait indefinitely for the items I already paid for.

To add insult to injury:

IKEA won’t let me return the shelves I did receive (despite the incomplete order).
IKEA won’t send me the missing shelves, even though they are now in stock.

"Absolutely shockingly terrible customer service . I visited IKEA Wembley on 28/12/2024 to purchase a table for my new home. I picked up the package from their self-serve warehouse, and everything seemed fine—it was properly packed. However, when I started assembling it, I realised that one item was missing, making it impossible to complete the table.

Since IKEA Greenwich is the closest store to my home, I went there to get a spare part, only to be told that I could only obtain it from the same store where I made the purchase. Imagine if I had bought the table in another town—that would have been quite an adventure. To make matters worse, the staff member at IKEA Greenwich suggested that I take a taxi all the way to Wembley just to get the missing part. She also mentioned that IKEA stores operate separately, so they cannot assist with issues from other branches.

I eventually got the spare part from Wembley, returned home, and resumed assembling, only to discover that another part was missing. On top of that, some parts were included in duplicate. This all happened before the New Year, and since then, dealing with their customer service has been a complete nightmare.

Every time I contacted their live chat, they gave me excuses about why my delivery was cancelled and why it couldn’t be delivered on the originally scheduled date. Add on top, that there are no emails or any kinds of updates from their side.

Long story short, it's now 08/02/2025, and I have received the wrong parts twice. One time, I didn’t receive anything at all because the delivery was cancelled.

After all this frustration, I requested a full table replacement, which was scheduled for 07/02/2025, but it never arrived—funny enough IKEA’s tracking page stating that it was ""Delivered"". Live-chat support said it was a glitch and they will manage it. Now, I have to wait for it to be rebooked for next week, and if not, then possibly the following week.

Their live chat support operates strictly from scripts and cannot provide real answers. If they don’t have a solution, they may even end the chat abruptly. This entire experience feels like a never-ending cycle, and I would not recommend dealing with their customer support at all.

Considering the number of negative reviews, it’s clear that this isn’t an isolated incident. If they fail you—and they often do—you’ll be stuck waiting indefinitely, with no resolution in sight.

Today is the third day of waiting, but the app tells me that I cancelled the parcel, but anything can happen and I can contact them later. This is of course good, BUT I did not cancel the parcel, I'm waiting for it! I tried calling the service center, half an hour on the line, they don't pick up. That's why I'm writing here.

"Unfriendly customer interface. Not customer friendly. Simple everyday customer matters such as returns interface not customer friendly, very difficult and frustrating! Disorganised, complicated! 😢 . Booked a collection of a wardrobe on call for a particular date due for two weeks after earliest collection. Couple days prior to the collection almost two weeks later with no notice I receive a missed call and a text message immediately afterwards telling me they tried to contact me to ‘confirm’ collection but I was unable to ‘confirm’ so they will cancel my collection if I don’t reply. I tried texting back but texts don’t go through to them so I called back within *10 minutes*! to return the missed call to ‘confirm’ my collection which I was on a phone call for 20 minutes for. The man told me it’s confirmed and I don’t need to do anything else.

That was on a Friday morning. Today, Monday 3pm I received a missed call from Ikea. 2 hours after I returned the missed call to find out what it’s about only to find out they had called me at 3pm to ‘confirm’ the collection only to inform me they had cancelled the collection because I didn’t contact them back today as well as last Friday when I did! And I need to wait another two weeks for the next collection date for a wardrobe and bunch of shelves in their original sealed packaging just waiting in my house taking the space.

The lady said i needed to contact them directly and when I said I tried but couldn’t so I had to contact the general Ikea customer service line, she then says, ‘that’s right, the store for collection doesn’t have a direct line you could contact them on so you needed to call the general Ikea customer service number like I did today, so I replied, that’s exactly what I did and the man told me thank you for confirming. I even was skeptical at first and explicitly asked him are you sure you confirmed it and he said yes.

When the lady said ‘it’s because you didn’t contact them back’ and when I heard the news, I expressed my confusion and disappointment without shouting and the lady accused me of ‘shouting at her’? She then became stern to tell me all she can do is book another collection. She wasn’t caring to understand my situation and also repeated I didn’t contact them back and I tried telling her I did! I even have the evidence in my recent phone call list on my iPhone. I asked isn’t there a collection earlier as I already waited two weeks and did nothing wrong:

I made a list of the article numbers I’m returning in their original packaging and moved the heavy boxes to my corridor, and the multiple big shelves in the living room floor, I identified which articles numbers I’m retuning per order as I had two orders with some items in each order needing to be retuned, I contacted Ikea to clearly tell them the list of items to be returned and the man curated a list of the items to be collected and booked a date with me on the phone call. I wrote down the collection reference number and set the event in my calendar, I returned the missed call last Friday within 10 minutes! I was very organised and doing my part, I don’t understand why you need to confirm 3 times!! Such a hassle and difficult customer service. I feel I am suffering at the expense or their disorganisation and being blamed for it. The lady told me nobody wrote on the note you had called to confirm when I did call and the man confirmed it he said. I did my part! This collection was so important I was counting the days down in my head, prepared to welcome the collection men for the collection because I waited 2 weeks and it’s a big collection taking space! Now I have to wait another two weeks and the lady gave me new reference numbers and I’m back at square one chasing them up. And if without notice they had contacted me and you’re not glued to your phone so it’s natural if you had missed a call, I contacted them back immediately, and the lady was very stern and accusing. I feel mistreated and it’s such a heavy burdening situation experience.

As for the assembly service I booked for the wardrobes, Ikea weren’t able to refund or cancel the items in the assembly I’m returning, so I had to pay assembly for the items I am returning?! I tried on the phone call for like 1 and half hour being transferred department to department and they couldn’t amend the assembly so I gave up. I didn’t think anything of it and let it go thinking it’s just a bit of a nick on an otherwise perfect furniture, delivery, assembly and procedure of booking the collection with them (seemingly at first) until their hassle and a difficulty of customer service they are really unfolded.

I like the ikea furniture range and interest free finance options. But unless you’re a perfect human being and didn’t make any mistakes in your order that’d need returning is when you really need to contact customer service to learn that they have appalling service when it comes to actually getting stuff done. I had never experienced this level of disorientation with any other retailer. Customer unfriendly interface. Difficult, not caring…",Trustpilot_USA
"Ikea Gift Card Purchase - Extremely Frustated . I had an extremely frustrating experience with IKEA's gift card service and customer support. On January 28, 2025, my father purchased a $1,000 gift card to help furnish my home. Neither of us received the gift card or any confirmation email. When I contacted IKEA, I was told the issue would be resolved within 48 hours. Unfortunately, there was no follow-up, no case number, and IKEA couldn't locate the purchase.

I was passed between customer support and Frizbee without meaningful updates, and I missed a sale on a sleeper sofa due to the delays. After several days of confusion and stress, Frizbee responded to me confirming that my father received the refund, but IKEA should resolve the issue directly.

This entire experience has been disappointing, with inadequate communication and service. I hope IKEA takes steps to improve its gift card process and customer support to prevent future cases like this. It was extremely frustrated.",Trustpilot_USA

On February 1,2025 as i wanted to build the wardrobes I realised more than 21 packages of the what I received were wrong. Called customer service to inform them about this. After hearing my complaints and assuring me that he is going to order the missing parts, he blamed me for not checking my packages before leaving. After wasting 30 minutes with the service personal on phone, he told me I need to go to Ikea ludwigsburg to lodge the complaints. On my way there, I received a call from Ikea Ludwigsburg stating that they made a mistake with my package and asked me to bring it back for the correct one and that they are going to refund my transport costs. When I got there, the refund was 20 Euros to my surprise. That was the refund for transporting wrong articles from Ikea to Heilbronn and back in addition to carrying the products up to the 2nd floor and hired transport costs. Not to add to the whole bad service , they asked me to bring the wrong package back myself. This is really a ridiculous service for a big company like Ikea. Very disappointed.

However, no delivery was made. Even worse, we received absolutely no updates or communication about any delays or changes to the schedule. We’re now left waiting indefinitely, hoping for an update whenever they decide to provide one.

When we contacted IKEA customer support, they were no help at all. Instead of resolving the issue, they placed the blame entirely on their delivery partner, DPD. As customers, this passing of responsibility is unacceptable—we expect IKEA to take ownership of the process.

When I placed the order, I registered with my email address and was able to login to comfirm my order. However, I did not receive either an email or paper confirmation of my order.

"Not even worthy of 1 star . Placed an order for delivery of ikea pax wardrobe on the 15th December.
The order delivery was firstly rescheduled by ikea from 23rd December to 27th December for an unknown reason.

Time slot was given on the 27th but no delivery was made. Spoke with customer services who lied to us saying it was on the truck for delivery and to be patient. The items did not arrive. Spoke to them again and delivery was rescheduled for the second time to the 2nd January.

Time slot provided again of 0730-1130 however on ikea app it stated that they were still packing our order therefore spoke to the live chat that said our delivery was on the truck; as we was lied to the first time, we decided to contact customer services who stated they had no idea where our order was. We asked if it would be possible to collect from our nearest store on the 2nd, they said that we could only collect from Warrington store (which is an hour away from us), and that some of our items would need to be hand picked from the actual store. When we arrived at Warrington we was given part of our order and they stated they did not have them as stock to pick from the store and that they would deliver these items to our closest store on Saturday 4th and that we would receive our confirmation on the morning of the items being shipped. No surprise - no email confirmation today. Also when taking the items back home, noticed one of the doors had a large crack in it; when contacting customer services she had stated that we would have to take the items back to Warrington. We argued that we would not be going out of our way again due to a fault of their own and they agreed to send out items to our closest store on the 6th January.

We contacted ikea customer service again as we still have no idea where our remaining items are, the man stated that they are still not available and won’t be until the 9th - 16th January and that he would send us a stock alert when this comes in. He also stated that these items would not be reserved and we would need to contact the store when the stock becomes available (however you can not contact the store directly) despite the fact that we have already paid for our items. I tried to argue the fact that we have paid and they should be reserved, however he become quite rude and stated I was not understand what he was saying. However I stated back that if 20 of our items are delivered to the store and 20 customers go in and buy it, we would again have to wait for our items as they would not be reserved to be sent to our nearest store.

Under no circumstances should anyone be ordering from ikea. They have basically ripped us off by not providing us with our items we have paid for. Customer services are a waste of time and won’t allow you with a phone number ( we asked for the number for Warrington customer services who we had been dealing with on the day and they said no, they don’t provided these numbers to customer). When attempting to make a complaint I was shut down on the phone stating to go to the website which is unhelpful as no actual email is provided, and you’re unable to go to the retail ombudsman without a written complaint being made.

The other issue is even worse. I ordered 2 cabinets and a counter top. They marked all items as shipped and the truck shows up with two cabinets and no counter top. I had to go without the counter top I ordered for weeks until they shipped it out when it became available. It was apparently out of stock, but despite that they told me it was in stock, took my money, and lied to me that it had been shipped. Weeks go by and I get another shipping notice for the counter top and so I prep the room and get everything ready. A truck shows up with NOTHING IN IT. They actually drove all the way to my house with out the counter top! I don't know how you can be so incompetent.

"IKEA Kitchens - good kitchens but very poor service and after sales from MK store . The kitchens are good quality and good value but you'll have to drive the whole process and constantly chase at every stage. This was the case at IKEA Milton Keynes - I have no idea who 'runs' the department. From paying for the kitchen in full right through to final installation which took many months (the fitting itself took 3 weeks) I had no contact from kitchen services apart from me chasing countless individuals for updates. On one occassion I contacted 3 named individuals in kitchen services with a query and got no reply. So it was back to the call centre queue.

There is no joined up process, a project plan is given by IKEA, but this is pure fantasy. There is no single point of contact; there is no dedicated support if anything is held up or goes wrong. You can get put through to a call centre, but you can't speak directly to kitchen services at the store - there is no number for this and you can't get put through. Our issues were relatively small, but if these were major, you'd have big problems.

The IKEA contracted fitters were excellent, but their their job is not to coordinate everything - it's to fit the kitchen. A call from IKEA kitchen services during installation was part of the project plan - to check all was going well, but this never happened.

From the moment we paid the full balance, there has been no follow up whatsoever from IKEA during or after the completed installation - zero!! That's over a 4 month period until now.

If they want to be a serious player in kitchens, they need a massive shake up, with several rockets fired up places where the sun doesn't shine.

We got there in the end, the kitchen is great and we are pleased with the final result, but we honestly couldn't recommend without the above caveats. As a final point, the initial measuring service, sales and design processes were great, but post sales it was incredibly poor.",Trustpilot_USA

It was cool; I decided just to contact customer service & ask to return part of the order that was messed up. After a confusing conversation with someone that didn’t seem to know much, I was told the return was started & I would have a label in my email. No label. Also, when the return showed up in my IKEA account, it looked like I was returning 2 of the same item, even though I only bought, received, and was returning one. I contacted them again to let them know their mistake & ask again for the label. Another weird, confusing chat with a guy who couldn’t seem to get what I was explaining. He finally told me he “fixed it” & I could just go to my email for the return label. That at least came through this (2nd) time around. I promptly FedExed the item with the label they sent me. A month later and no refund, so I contact them again and was told they never received it. I had FedEx tracking to prove they had indeed received it a month ago. At this point I also noticed that once again in my account, the 2nd representative had made the same mistake as the first one. He showed I was returning 2 of the same item. The account looked like I was now returning four of the same item. This (3rd) representative couldn’t figure out what to do. It took another (4th) call to customer service for someone to take the time to look up the FedEx tracking themselves & see that they had indeed received the return. Did this result in a refund? Nope. Now there is just a “ticket”still floating around somewhere requesting my refund again. I won't get my hopes up. This has taken up ALOT of time & has been really frustrating. Plus, they still have the item AND my money. Until the last person I spoke with, everyone in customer service put in half hearted efforts (with obviously no training.

We placed quite a large order, which included a 3-seater sofa and separately a cover for it. The cover, despite the correct code didn't fit 3-seater and was clearly made to fit a 2-seater sofa of the same range. Since then the nightmares began:

- We requested a replacement and were sent another 2-seater sized cover
- Hours of waiting time in store to return both covers
- No such covers in the local stores so we can try before buying
- Tried to contact online support - lady didn't even understand the matter, let alone was able to help. When asked to speak with management - she said no and left chat... Shocking!!!

I ordered a pax wardrobe for delivery, instead IKEA delivered a few sets of drawers!

IKEA may be cheap and sometimes stock good quality but their service and delivery is the worst ever and you will regret ever shopping there! Please read through my experience at IKEA in Plano, TX below - you will understand.
———
Hello, this pertains to order xxxxx (IKEA, Plano, TX) that was NOT made today.
1. IKEA rescheduled the original delivery one on the day scheduled and I had asked for, (last week on 7th) when I was home to receive the delivery.
2. They rescheduled for 12th without my permission (no choice provided to reschedule by phone or on website which grayed out options) - I am traveling and out of town on 12th. No one in IKEA takes responsibility after you swipe your card and by their stuff.
3. I instructed the building manager to let the delivery into my apartment and authorized them to accept on my behalf today. They were kind enough to do so.
4. The delivery was not made despite my speaking and asking the delivery company to do so - see my text exchange with your delivery service below. Extremely putting-off, no sense of helping a customer - how can a company ever accept treating customers with such disdain- I for one will never step into their stores again!

There has been no consideration for customer service and your site does not allow me to cancel the order or reschedule. This is not just disappointing but extremely inconvenient as I need this furniture in the apartment and I’m away traveling- what can you do to sort this out!",Trustpilot_USA

Called up to complain and was told 72 hours for a reply in regards to the matter. Had to wait a week and a half with me calling up numerous times to chase them up only to get told the same thing of “it’s being escalated”. After all the stress and my mental health being affected, they offered to only waive the delivery fee (£40) and offer me a £40 gift card as a form of goodwill gesture. Only at this point could they then complete the exchange for the damaged items for the new items we needed. Placed the order and the day before was told everything is due to be on track and delivered on time only to then call up at 7am the day of delivery to say I have not received a tracking link and the advisor said it’s been delayed by two days. I was not notified of this and according to their system they attempted to contact me but I did not receive a phone call from anyone at the time they stated.

"Delivery from IKEA Wilrijk in Belgium . A year and a half ago, while living in Greece, we ordered from an IKEA shop in Thessaloniki. It was supposed to be delivered in a couple of days, but it took more than a month! That time the staff referred to some problem with the ""system"". Ok, whatever. Being late is not considered such a serious offence in Greece.
But history repeats itself, this time in Belgium.
Last week, on 27/11, we placed an order number 1480812052 at the IKEA Wilrijk shop. It was supposed to be delivered today, 02/12. Of course, nothing was delivered. No one even warned us that there was no point in sitting at home all day waiting for the order. After a long (more than an hour) wait for a reply in chat, we were told that our order was ""stuck in the system"". Ok, probably right in the middle. So, once again, it was nobody's fault but the proverbial ""system"".
As a result, our order was assigned a different number (1482990540) and its delivery was postponed for 4 days. Well, we'll have to sit at home for another day waiting. Will our order arrive, or will we have to wait a month for it, as it was in Greece? We'll see.
It seems to me that the company's policy is to blame for this situation. It allows customers to place more orders via the website than the shops are able to process. And in the case of customer enquiries, the employees are forced to blame ""the system"".
Update from 05/12: They cancelled the 'second' order without notifying us. I'm not even sure I can get my money back.

"Ikea is good BUT the shipping company used: awful . TLDR version: IKEA is great, it is their in-home delivery service I had a major issue with and will never use again, because of the shipping company used.

I have recently experienced an ordeal which prevents me from rating one of otherwise really nice stores higher. Actually, I am only giving three stars at all just because I am rating IKEA, not the delivery fiasco. IKEA is nice. Their customer support did their best. In the end, they did all they could, really, and once I cancelled the (probably cursed) order, they returned my money straight away with no problem, I went to IKEA myself, and picked up at least a bed with no issues, quickly, and with the staff on site being really kind and helpful. But before this happy ending, a literal nightmare took place over the course of 3 (or 4, don't remember anymore) days. Thing is, I moved to the US from Europe. And because I was moving into an unfurnished apartment, I turned to IKEA to purchase some starting necessities like a bed with a mattress and sheets, some basic cookware, a bin, some glasses... things you don't pack when you're moving overseas. Because I needed a US phone number, which of course I couldn't get before getting to the US, I used an app that could give me a temporary US phone number, and my goal was to arrange a normal US SIM a soon as I arrived. Everything went smoothly, I ordered an in-apartment delivery for my move-in date. Unfortunately, the day of, I found out the app doesn't work and I couldn't access my temp phone number. I immediately called IKEA, a few hours before the supposed delivery, hoping I will be able to get a message across to the driver of the truck to call a different number which I was able to arrange upon my arrival. IKEA informed me that for these deliveries, they cannot change the phone number once the delivery was placed. Thus ended my first call with them. I called again and asked if anything can be done at all, like them giving me contact info for the delivery company. They did not, but made a note in their system with the new number. Nobody called me, and the delivery was noted as failed a little while later, so I called IKEA again (call number 3, still okay-ish), asking what happened and if they could put me in touch with anyone in the shipping company to hopefully get the message across to the driver. They did, and I started calling the shipping company. This is where my patience started wearing thin, because for such a simple thing as a different phone number, there appeared to be no solution. The customer service kept telling me what they cannot do and what IKEA must do, so I kept calling back and forth with both, resulting in no less than 18 (yes, bloody EIGHTEEN) calls with customer support of IKEA and the shipping company. The shipping company kept asking IKEA to change the number in many different ways, and IKEA kept doing it and helping me as best they could but still the driver apparently kept calling the old number on a total of four (as far as I can recall, could have been more) failed delivery attempts. When the situation started to come truly full circle, I have decided that repeating the same pattern and expecting a different result would indeed be a sign of insanity, and called IKEA for a final time to cancel the order. Before that, I called the shipping company to inform them that unless the driver calls the correct number and delivers my stuff that very day, I won't be able to receive the goods anyway because I started at my new job on the next business day and will not have time to wait for a call that is not coming at home anymore. They tried to persuade me to still wait, but were unable to give me any specifications or assurances the driver will indeed call the correct phone number that by that time has been probably plastered all over every piece of documentation regarding that order by both IKEA and, if one could believe them, the shipping company. At that point I just wanted my bed, and to not sleep on a borrowed air mattress anymore, so I said I do not care anymore, cancelled the order and just asked a friend to help me get some of the stuff in person.",Trustpilot_USA

Why wouldn’t they have alerted us at the time of ordering? So now we have to spend time and money to find an IKEA location which will be nowhere near our new home or pay for delivery because of their doing. Not great customer service at all.

"Appalling Service and Endless Delays with Kitchen Installation . We hired IKEA to design and install our kitchen, and it’s been a nightmare from the start. After months of back-and-forth, with multiple incorrect drawings and repeated errors, we finally thought the installation was on track. IKEA assured us the kitchen would be delivered two days before installation, but weeks later, the boxes are still sitting in my home.

The initial install date of November 4th was delayed to the 12th, yet today is the 12th, and no one has shown up. Despite calling IKEA multiple times, we received no follow-up. We were repeatedly promised call-backs that never happened.

With two young children, having no kitchen for weeks is beyond inconvenient—it’s unbearable. IKEA’s lack of communication and accountability has turned this process into a complete disaster.

"Please don’t buy your kitchen from here . Please don’t buy your kitchen from here!

We purchased our kitchen from Ikea after shopping around, they were the most reasonably priced and we liked the style and options, our kitchen planner in store was really nice and created a super positive experience for us.

However it’s been a complete nightmare ever since the purchase. Original delivery date, the delivery never turned up, I phoned customer service to be told the truck it was on had broken down.. sure.

So the whole order is repurchased by Ikea and a new delivery date is set, it gets delivered a day before the fitters arrive instead of a week. Fitters show up and can’t do anything due to missing items from the delivery, no cupboard stands or anything. Fitters leave and we await the delivery of the missing items, these arrive in loads of different delivery’s and boxes forcing our neighbours to take in loads of different parcels.

Fitters take ages to be rearranged due to the incompetence of Ikea, they arrive one day without even informing us they were booked to arrive! They finally arrive at a date we were informed of just to tell us they are still missing items from the order and that his apprentice was supposed to account for those items?

Unacceptable.

So we’ve been left without a kitchen for over 8 weeks, no running water as we don’t have a tap or anything. Customer service are absolutely useless, at least an hours wait on the phone before you can even speak to someone.

Please please get your kitchen from somewhere else! What was supposed to be an exciting time of our first kitchen for our first house is now just dread, worry and constant frustrating phone calls. Worst experience ever.",Trustpilot_USA

Ikea kitchen . We ordered a kitchen from ikea Ireland. The planning went well and we had 3 orders with some items that were custom made so they could take up to 8 weeks.

The fitting team got different dates for taking the old kitchen out and fitting the new kitchen. There was a delay and now again there is a delay.

"Appalling customer service . Appalling customer service. We ordered a Havsta storage cabinet with a combination of pieces. When we unpacked a couple of the boxes, we discovered marks all over the wood (it turns out it's the wood knots and with the thin paint on top, it looks like there are lots of dirty marks everywhere). We then organised a collection / delivery of the faulty pieces, thinking that was all fine. Then I received a confirmation email and noticed that they have noted down the wrong items for exchange, but after a phone call, we were told that all has been ammended and everything was fine.
Cue the delivery date, I phone in the morning to get a time estimate (as it's a 12 HOURS long slot), and I'm told ""everything is fine"" and they'll let me know when the delivery will take place. Several hours pass, and I phone again to get a timing, and that's when I'm told that the collection has been cancelled - because of the original issue with the bar codes of items having been wrong. No warning, no communication. The delivery of the exchange items has been remade without checking with me, and now the collection can only be re-arranged for a week's time.
I explained that having all these boxes in my home everywhere is really difficult and that given it's their mistake on several counts (faulty product, mistake noting the car codes of items for exchange, cancelling the collection with no communication), it's really for them to resolve. This is the part that I'm the most shocked by, there was literally no flexibility, and a ""it's your issue to deal with, not ours"" attitude. I asked to speak to someone else and was told that that I couldn't do that, as they would just say the same thing. Effectively it was too bad, and I'd just have to lump it.
I'm now left with a room full of boxes, having spent all day during the children's half term at home waiting, and just a really unpleasant feeling about how badly IKEA treat their customers.

I went thinking the return period was 365 days but they said they wouldn't take them. The person at the cash register was named Meyar, she was very rude. They didn't care about us because our English was bad. The only thing she said was the word no. Then his supervisor came and he said definitely couldn't take them. Then another manager came and looked at the product and said she could take it back but give store credit. Then another manager came and said the same thing, we didn't want it and while they were there checking the return policy, they first said they were open until 9 o'clock and you can wait, but then when a few customers supported us, they told us to leave Ikea or they would call the police, my husband and I said call them, we are not causing any problems, we are just here to get our rights. Of course we waited there and they couldn't call the police because we didn't do anything wrong. The customers there said they listened to the issue and were sorry about the situation, how immoral it was to threaten us with the police and that they would write a complaint to IKEA.

"IKEA - 2 Stars . I've been a loyal IKEA customer for years and have always appreciated their designs and affordability. However, my recent experience has been disappointing. I purchased the FRIHETEN sofa-bed, and initially, it was a great addition to our home—comfortable and functional.

When I reached out to IKEA customer service, I was informed that the damage was due to misuse and improper maintenance, so it wasn't covered under their 10-year guarantee. This was frustrating because we used the sofa exactly as intended and took good care of it.

"Buyer beware of IKEA kitchens . My wife and I ordered a kitchen after a long decision making process and paid in total in May. We had visits from the fitter to assess and all appeared well. We were promised a delivery date of 29th September (today). Our old kitchen has been removed and we are basically camping in the house. We awaited the kitchen and when it did not appear contacted customer services. Several long calls later and told that several items were no longer available, such as the dishwasher ( that we assumed wrongly would be reserved for us as we had paid for it), the oven and several other small items. We were told that they could cancel so that we could reorder but this would affect the installation date. We have ordered lighting and worktops from a different supplier that have arrived for the install. I have arranged annual leave for the installation. No offer to compensate. Little in the way of apology. It's like they couldn't care less. Shockingly poor customer service.",Trustpilot_USA

"IKEA -Awful Customer Service . I bought a dresser online 7/29/24 and it was delivered damaged so I called immediately and took pictures. We are now at 9/24/24, so right at 2 months and I am still dealing with trying to be refunded for this dresser. They give you the run around by taking the same information over and over on every call and then tell you it has to be escalated to a higher tier to approve a discount. It went weeks with no response to be told that they would only offer 35%. Even though i didn’t agree because i felt the damage and my time spent dealing with them warranted more than 35% I went ahead and accepted the offer which was sent to me via email. I called to confirm I would accept the discount and again all my info was taken again and I was told it would be 3-5 days and I would see the refund…. Well that didn’t happen. I got an email on 9/4/24 saying they couldn’t reach me by the number I gave them (untrue) because it’s the number I call from and verify everytime I call them. So I Made another call today and explained the entire story again to be put on hold for 20 min so Anupoim the person helping me could ask if the refund could be put on my debit card ( that was not what he was doing, I can assure you that) he comes back and and just says OK and I say ok what? What’s happening, because he never verified the card, never said when to expect the refund, and when I asked he said “you just wait” I had to ask how he was planning on refunding my money and when. So I’ve been told again 3-5 business days.. I have no trust in this happening because it’s been 2 months of dealing with them and over 15 calls to them and nothing has happened at this point in time. They have awful customer service and follow through. I will never order online from them again because this is the run around you get if you receive an item that’s damaged. Then if you want to return it they want you to disassemble and put back in their boxes.. that’s a joke because it’s been 2 months those boxes long gone in the trash. Not to mention my time to disassemble the product. IKEA does not value the customer experience nor do they want to really make it right for the customer, in fact they use every tactic to try not make it right by making the process as long and complicated as possible.

"IKEA needs to stop using Top Delivery Service . Awful service with getting my IKEA kitchen delivery. I used IKEA to design and process my kitchen. Planned and paid for weeks ago for the kitchen to be delivered on September 19th 2024. Top Delivery Service didn’t show up. According to the email and text messages, TDS is supposed to ring you half an hour before they arrive, they never did. According to TDS track and trace, they were 1 stop away for more than an hour. Then suddenly 3 stops away. They were already extremely late according to their own delivery window. At this point I contacted TDS and they said that the truck had an issue and they won’t be able to deliver the kitchen, and that they have contacted IKEA and that IKEA will contact me to create a new appointment. TDS made no attempt to contact me. I only found this out by me contacting them. I had to call IKEA support the next day as it was already gone 18:00. Next morning I called IKEA support, they had no idea that there was an issue with my delivery. So TDS lied about contacting IKEA. IKEA support called TDS to find out where my kitchen was, and IKEA said that my kitchen was still in the truck, because the truck had an issue recharging. (Electric vehicle). I asked IKEA to ask TDS to send another truck to get my kitchen. (I had hired contractors to help me build the kitchen, taken time off work, and have no current working kitchen because it was supposed to arrive on the 19th.) IKEA said they will call me back in 30 mins to see what solution they can get me. 4 hours later I heard nothing from IKEA so I called them again. This time IKEA contacted TDS and said the truck was in an accident. And the truck won’t get fixed till next week. And the driver is refusing to allow another truck to collect my kitchen. IKEA said I will get compensation for each day the kitchen is delayed. I got a new order delivery date which is 24th September, as TDS couldn’t deliver on Monday and they wouldn’t know if the truck would be working. I also emailed TDS asking why a delivery company doesn’t have an extra truck to collect my kitchen from the broken truck. I have had zero response. On Monday (23rd September) I call IKEA to make sure that TDS is actually delivering on Tuesday (24th September). IKEA support couldn’t tell me because they had no way of contacting TDS. So, to recap. TDS truck ran out of electricity, also had an accident, IKEA can contact TDS and IKEA cannot contact TDS. Luckily I got a track and trace message on the Monday night saying my kitchen should arrive between 12:45 and 14:45 on Tuesday the 24th of September. It is now 00:27 Wednesday 25th of September and I still have not got my kitchen, and zero communication from TDS. I do not understand why IKEA keeps using this company to deliver its kitchens. This has been an awful, stressful and expensive experience. I will not be buying from IKEA again and I certainly hope TDS never delivers anything for me again.

So now Top Delivery Service has failed to delivery my kitchen twice, with zero communication. I will have to call IKEA again…",Trustpilot_USA

"Avoid IKEA for Kitchen Installation - A nightmare Experience! . I am incredibly disappointed with the kitchen purchasing and installation service I received from IKEA.

The design service was great, and the staff were professional and helpful. However, that's where the positives end. The assigned kitchen installer, visited my home to inspect the site on and he didn't agree with the drawings. My kitchen was scheduled for delivery 8 weeks later, but the delivery was incomplete, and installation was delayed multiple times. I was left without a functional kitchen for five weeks – no running water, no sink, no basic kitchen facilities. It was an absolute nightmare, leaving me in a situation that no household should have to endure.

Worse still, the responsibility for these delays was continually passed between IKEA and their installation team. IKEA blamed the installers, and the installers pointed the finger back at IKEA. The complete lack of coordination and accountability was frustrating, to say the least.

Despite numerous calls to IKEA’s customer service, I was repeatedly given empty promises. I was assured that the issues would be resolved, but no one ever followed up. I spent weeks chasing answers on my own, and the level of customer service I experienced was far below what I would expect from a company like IKEA, especially after spending such a significant amount of money. After the installation was completed, I contacted IKEA to highlight the issues I had and once again I was completely ignored.

This experience has been so negative that I would strongly advise anyone to avoid IKEA for kitchen installations. While the initial design process was great, everything that followed has been an utter disaster.

IKEA needs to seriously improve its service, communication, and accountability. This ordeal has been stressful, inconvenient, and entirely unacceptable. Save yourself the frustration and look elsewhere for your kitchen needs.",Trustpilot_USA

"Terrible delivery and support service . Ordered a kitchen and its installation in August this year. The quality is good and the montage team is professional and friendly. At least that’s what I can say based on a half assembled kitchen.
On the other hand the delivery and IKEA support are just terrible. Delivery guys will look for any excuse to deliver everything only to the ground floor (I live on the 4th floor and IKEA support assured me that the delivery will be to the flat). Kitchen should have arrived in four parts. Two times the delivery team rejected bringing the packages to the 4th floor. First time I had to bring the heavy oven myself to my floor. Second time after a quick argument the guys just drove away together with the working tops and reported that I wasn’t at home when they arrived.
As for IKEA support. The chat on the website is always “too busy, no one is available at the moment”. Every time you try a phone call, you have to wait for 20-30 minutes for their response (which also might end with a hang up).
The montage team promised me that in a few days IKEA will contact me and they will finish the delivery and the installation. Two weeks have already passed and nothing happened. When I tried to call IKEA support. After another 20-30 minutes of waiting they said that they don’t have support for that question in English and suggested that I try my luck and go to their store: maybe there will be a person who will be able to help me.

"Visited for the first time in many years .... . For the first time in many years, I went to the Wednesbury branch a couple of times in the last week, to get ideas for a kitchen extension.

1. Plenty of great ideas for kitchens, organising etc. Well thought out stuff.
2. Their very short standard lengths of laminate worktops are well priced. The moment you go over the standard length by even a cm, as many people will as the standard lengths are so short, the price triples.
3. The Kungsfors range of shelves, suspension rails and organisation is excellent and a huge centrepiece of Ikea kitchen organisation - but bizarrely, there's not a single example of the shelf system set up in any of their kitchens, or any demonstration of their versatility.
4. Too many (all?) of their kitchens on display are completely without mock electricity sockets. It gives an unrealistic view of organising the worktop space and walls above it.
5. I hated visiting Ikea in the past because once in, it is very difficult to leave - few exit signs, a long walk to get out. It's like a nightmare you struggle to wake up from. Their buildings always gives me a nauseating, sick feeling, very claustrophobic.
6. If you try to order a lot of stuff online, you'll run into delivery and availability issues; some products will be available online but not in a store, and some available in a store but not online, and some will be available in one store but not another. But surely, all products should be available at all times online? Very difficult to order all the items you need without faffing about.

I bought a few Billy bookcases second-hand, and, they didn't come with the metal brackets to fix them to the wall (it's for safety, so they won't fall over) and, while looking for them online I've found that IKEA offers spare parts (small ones) for their products, for free, shipped to your door.

So, I ordered the amount I needed, and in a few days they arrived, and I got the bookcases fixed to the walls securely.

Thank you for that.",Trustpilot_USA
"IKEA SUCKS . I did not suspect that IKEA, the huge company IKEA, would allow their customer service to be this horrible. I literally contacted them around 20 times. They delievered a closet system with two different sizes for the base and the doors. I spent 200 building it until the builder noticed that it did not fit. I made a Request for a pickup. They had me waiting 2 weeks for the first ""pickup"". I missed the day from work waiting. Nothing. They kept telling me to wait. Until it was 7 pm and they said, sorry, something happened, theyre coming tomorrow, and then tomorrow, they never came. Same story. for 2 weeks. I called two to three times daily with their horrible waiting times. Each time they said something different but were consistently clueless about what the last person said. They said they would refund the product but did not. I tried talking to supervisors, but they said they were not allowed to talk to supervisors. Get this: they gave a FAKE email of a supervisor! It was so stressful! I had to dispute the charge with my credit card! And afterward, guess what? They did come to pick up their items on a Sunday without letting me know!

"No items delivered, shocking customer service . I was supposed to receive a delivery today the 18th between 9am-1pm as stated in the message I received last Friday. At 12:25pm I phoned IKEA in Dublin to query where the delivery was as there wasn't any updates on my online account. I spoke to a man named John who apologised and assured me my delivery was 15 minutes delayed but I would receive it shortly. At 2:06pm I phoned back and was speaking to a different man who told me I probably wouldn't have my delivery today as it actually never even left the hub. So clearly John couldn't be bothered looking into this correctly and fobbed me off. I specifically booked a Sunday delivery to ensure I would be around to receive the order to which now was a complete waste of my day. They told me they could leave the delivery at the front of my house if I wasn't at home but seriously who would willing want to leave over €300 worth of goods out in plain sight for anyone to take. The 2nd man I spoke to told me I would receive an email confirming I would be compensated from IKEA if I didn't have my order by 7pm this evening and surprise surprise that's another lie as I still haven't received the official email. Absolutely shocking service considering they charge enough for delivery.

"I purchased an Order from Ikea… . I purchased an Order from Ikea Hammersmith branch on their assurance that all the items would be delivered to the third floor.
Please note my purchases amounted to £ 1736.00 and I was assured that the delivery would be door to door.
However, your Ikea Driver failed to fulfil this service and dumped the 2 large packages containing the sofas, outside the building and left.

I first received a call from the driver this morning informing that he was at the premises and would need some one to come down and meet him.
my builder who was working on my apartment met him. The driver then called me back to say he was unable to deliver the 2 sofas to my apartment door. I immediately called customer Services and spoke to Temilola , who was most helpful and spoke to the delivery transport department. She asked me if I would take full responsibility for any damage which might occur if they took it up to the third floor, to which I assured I would do so. She tried to contact the driver but was not able to speak to him . Eventually the driver informed my Builder that he would leave the packages outside the building and go off.

I immediately went personally to the Hammersmith Branch and spoke to Tony the manager, who confirmed that all orders are door to door service.
I told him that it cost me an additional £300.00 to pay for two people to carry the goods to the third floor.
He said he would reimburse me if I would give him a VAT receipt from my builder. However my builder is not registered for VAT.

"Conflicting information and still not… . Conflicting information and still not received my money back for goods I never received.

I went into Milton Keynes store and purchased a variety of furniture, I was told if I wanted delivery I should purchase first then bring to the customer service desk which I did, I was then told delivery would be a week, I asked if its possible to cancel this whole purchase and order online if it could be delivered faster, I had now physically seen the items and wanted it in next couple of days,
After 10-15 mins of standing in front of customer services in MK store the chap said not possible to deliver before a week, the other option was collect from Tesco, but that did not apply to me as they don't deliver to my area, So I lumped it and agreed to accept the delivery in a week,
So I drove home 3 hours, Then went online only to see they do deliver to my local Tesco and I could have the next day!
I have called and cancelled this order but still after 2 weeks received nothing back, I had also ordered more furniture that was not collected as went on holiday that also not refunded.

I have had nothing but lies from the Peterbourgh number call centre, One person tells me my refund already processed and its my bank card with the problem , another tells me not yet processed, so after 8 phone calls of nonsense I just called the card company and dispute the payments as I not received any of this stuff yet I not got any of my money back.

According to the Ikea people on the phone there is no way to complain or escalate this nonsense ,,
I suggest if you are in similar situation to contact your credit card issuer and make a ""section 75"" claim ,, the more hassle that visa and master card receive about the same company will make Ikea pull their socks up.

I just cannot give them more then 1 star , absolutely annoying , stressful and waste of everyone's time for some thing so simple, Its like a broken record speaking to someone on the phone who never fixes the situation then gives you fabricated information, yet totally unaccountable , I even have recorded phone conversations with them but have no where to turn to as according to them they don't have a CEO or other body to contact except the person on the phone",Trustpilot_USA

I have called multiple times, always at least 30 mins before I get to speak to someone to find out that 'someone is working on it they will call back'; 12 weeks later and neither me nor the installation company that was sub-contracted can get any information as to when it might be finished.

"Just awful customer service . I am reticent to write this review, because I genuinely think IKEA has some wonderful products and their showroom is amazing, but the customer service is dire.

I had an issue a few years back regarding part delivery of a sofa. I took a day off for redelivery of the missing part but it still didn’t come. I then had to take another day off, go to a showroom and wait two hours whilst someone signed it off to get the final part of the sofa, that I had bought.

The reason for this review is that I bought two wardrobes around six years ago. The wardrobes are great and have lasted, but the backs of the wardrobes haven’t survived my last move unfortunately. I went onto live chat during my lunch break to see if I could BUY (not blag for free) two new backs for the wardrobes and some nails. I am offering to buy something that they will have in every warehouse up and down the country.

I was asked for an all the details of my original order, which I don’t have due it being six years ago. The advisor then said my purchase fell outside the guarantee and that he could not help. I re-emphasised that I do not want these items for free, I will pay for them (and delivery. And for the damn nails, of which they will have millions lying around) but he said they don’t do that.

I was then told the only solution is to buy two new wardrobes (in order to get the two backs in need for the wardrobes I already have). Honestly, no word of a lie, that is the only solution offered.

I just don’t understand, ikea has a wonderful concept and great buying experience but the customer service afterwards is awful. I’ve spent £,000’s with them over the years, even after my first issue, but now I won’t. I’ve literally got a list on my table (also from ikea) of 10 things I was planning to get from them for my upcoming move.

Renovating -> quick sale desirable -> let's try the IKEA buyback program, online offer €100 following their terms. Disassemble bed, load to a car, travel to IKEA Amersfoort.

Smug smile ""good shape, you'll get €75"". ""No, that's not what your terms say."" ""I'm not here to discuss, it's a large piece, it'll take a lot of space, accept 75 or you can take it back home.

Sent the return to Tempe AZ. Well nobody at the store would sign for the package so it sat collecting dust at USPS and there was no way for me to contact the actual store as they don't take phone calls!

"This has been a nightmare . This has been a nightmare!

I should have known when the order was placed and 6 out of the 9 doors needed were listed as “out of stock”. The customer service agent was very positive on that call. She stated that she was sure they would be back in stock on Monday (this was a Saturday) so we could place a second order for those on Monday to accompany this order. She was absolutely correct! They were back in stock……but then we have problem #2, delivery on those doors were no longer an option as it states the “truck was full”. After speaking with MANY customer service agents, was finally transferred to one who could resolve the issue and had the 6 remaining doors Fed Ex to my home to arrive the same day as the delivery of everything else on the 18th.

Fast forward to the 18th…at this point, I have received several text messages confirming and appointing a time for delivery for this day from the delivery company. Original time is between 4p-8p. Then another text stating 7p-9p. At 9:25, an email arrive stating that the distance for delivery was too far for the delivery company and my order would have to be rescheduled. I called customer service and the gentleman confirmed my order would be delivered the next morning by 9am. At 9:30, no delivery received, so I once again call customer service. I spoke with another lady who states #1 it was not rescheduled for today, #2 the next available delivery date would be the 25th, #3 the delivery address was too far for the delivery company, #4 Fed Ex was not an option for these pieces, #5 a Supervisor has to be notified by an open case and will return your call. The agents cannot forward calls to Supervisors.

#1- So I was lied to the night before?
#2- The issues and concerns with why it hasn’t been delivered as of yet will not exist on the 25th for a delivery?
#3- IKEA sent my order to a delivery company that cannot deliver to this address, but your agent would like to reschedule with the same delivery company?
#4- She further stated Fed Ex does not deliver large items which I had to call her on as I told her we have had multiple large items delivered by them which is why Fed Ex utilizes large trucks.
#5- You, as a customer, are not important enough to speak with Supervisors when your issues are not being resolved by customer service. You must be “scheduled” (as I was told she had me on the schedule to be called at 1pm).

Very, very poor customer services! One of the solutions offered was for me, as the customer, to drive over an hour away to “pick up” my order, which would require a trailer rental, and they would “waive the pick up fee”. However, that also has to be scheduled on their timeframe. It was very easy to accept my order stating my address was acceptable, accept my money, but cannot deliver customer service or delivery of what was promised when my order and money was accepted.",Trustpilot_USA

The money for the rest was back into my ban account but the gift card is basically ""burned"" and I realized through 1000 phone calls that their super inefficient ""gift card department"" needs to issue a new one, which I should receive shortly after the cancelation.
But again some of their colleagues said I should email them and ask for a new one, of course I did so.
So far no answer, seems like the so called department is not bothering as the money is in their bank account since many months ago and they do not see a reason to work on sth which is already paid for! Very shameful!",Trustpilot_USA
"Tale of the disappeared kitchen… . I recently ordered and paid for a kitchen from IKEA to arrive on a set date. The Friday before the delivery, I received a confusing email with both confirmation of the order, and a pdf of a refund for some of the amount paid.
I checked my bank the next morning and a partial sum was there. Why? I called customer service any they said that no problem, the delivery was still planned, but then after checking to confirm, said ah yes, it had been cancelled, as IKEA had taken the decision to reimburse for the kitchen as some of the items were not available any more (although they had been when I paid for them). I'd also bought a bed ( needed for during the renovation), which had been voluntarily cancelled by IKEA too. However, it seems some €160 worth of spare pieces (batons for mounting dishwasher, carbon filters, decorative mouldings) are still arriving by post on Tuesday!
This is just a mess, and a major inconvenience as the cost in time and money is considerable - we had also made travel arrangements to be there on site for Tuesday. Needless to say we are furious at the lack of service and valid explanation for this failure to fulfill a completed order.. Noone bothered to let me know, or check if we may need some of the other items on the order (bed?) before to taking the decision to cancel the order.
Neglectful, soulless big business, and very far from 'The Wonderful Everyday'. Not feeling it from IKEA. Shameful.",Trustpilot_USA

He didn't call or try to reach me out, I went outside to show him where to park but he just left and didn't deliver any items to me. Then I called customer support and asked if the driver can come back and deliver the items. He spoke to the driver and it wasn't possible so after that I got a booking for delivery on day which doesn't suit me at all. I was transferred to another person in customer support and after a long conversation it turned out that there was no order and none of my items in the truck at all. Although I got a tracking link and information from IKEA that my order will be delivered today from 12:30 to 15:30, and didn't get any cancellation prove. So in the end we agreed that the click and collect will be picked up. Even though we found a solution, I find it completely unprofessional from IKEA's side, from the driver's side or carriers side, and from the customer service side, as I did not receive any notification that my order will not be delivered today.

Panels, doors etc still sold but hinges won't match our old base units. Means ripping out complete kitchen and buying all new units.

"Unbelievably poor quality products . I had a Bestå TV cabinet delivered. Nearly £200 is not big money for a piece of furniture but it replaced an excellent Ikea TV bench that was only £80, albeit 10 years ago.
It arrived in two boxes, including one huge box, opened with the shelves and other items just tossed in. All 4 shelves had chipped corners. I only noticed 2 were chipped before contacting them for replacements unfortunately. No account or phone options so spent nearly 1 hour online waiting for someone to answer (you can return from your account but once you get through the process, right at the end you’re told to contact customer service. Terrible customer experience!)
Onto the unit. It’s cheap, featherweight chipboard of the poorest quality, unbelievably soft and shows any marks - in fact it’s almost impossible not to damage when assembling with the baffling instructions (one of the problems of the modular design - the instructions come with each individual item and parts that don’t apply - and the instructions for the hinges are on the plastic packaging and barely readable.)
The whole unit is so cheap and flimsy, with plastic fasteners, and cheap wood that it’s not even square. The hinges are adjustable and you will need that adjustment as it’s simply not possible to get the middle and the outer vertical edges of the doors square. It’s something I’d expect from a no name cheap discount store for £50, not from a global branded product nearly four times that price!
They did send 2 new doors free of charge that were thankfully not damaged in transit - more luck than design as the packaging was again poor.

The icing on the cake was deleting my review on their website. There are some negative reviews but I wouldn’t trust what’s written as there are a lot of similar glowing reviews that look suspiciously like bots.

"Ikea stopped caring . We have been regular customers for years and have spent plenty there. Two and a half years ago we bought a boxspring bed complete with a mattress and top mattress. The assistant told us that there was a 10 year guarantee on everything. Two and a half years later, the topper was not useable any longer. It was lumpy, flat and painful to lay on. I contacted Ikea and was told that the top mattress only had a two year guarantee so there was nothing they could do to help. The topper was one of the most expensive ones in the store so we expected more than two years use. I was not happy with the online chat so called the customer service dept. The lady on the phone was very rude and unhelpful. We were lied to and had to buy a new topper. Needless to say, we didn't buy it at Ikea. The customer service used to be good.

"Keep all your tracking numbers etc . Ordered out door furniture in early May. Delivered as planned, but part of the order was missing. IKEA informed and missing part sent out. This was the wrong part, so returned. Numerous contact by phone and web chat, but as of 4th June still no part, despite promises of delivery on the 28th May. Most recent conversation was for delivery on the 6th June. All the agents are very helpful, but it’s the behind the scenes part that appears to not know what’s happening. We have been offered some sort of goodwill gesture, which is good, but it really is a poor reflection on IKEA, that this level of disorganisation exists in IKEA. Today is the 7th June, and still we have no delivery. I have spent more time than I care to think chasing this order. IKEA are simply useless, and to be avoided at all costs. One star is being generous. I also requested a call back from a supervisor and to date still awaiting that.

Ikea sent their not very impartial sofa agent to inspect, who found sofa to be faulty. Ikea acknowledged faults/failings. But it has taken them almost two years now and still there is no replacement sofa, the price of the sofa has gone up from 669.00 in 2021 to 930.00 now. So for almost two years they have provided regular excuses on sofa unavailable, or out of stock or something similar. Now they are threatening me with closing my case - Enrika has decided, unilaterally, like some fascist state that Ikea can decided when they have had enough of customers who have been failed by Ikea.

I am heavily pregnant, I also have a toddler with me in a pushchair, and I asked two different members of staff to see if they could help me carry a box out to my car, which was in the loading bay.
I was told no, if your car isn't directly outside, we're not insured, and we can't help you.
I don't understand where the wires kept getting crossed but I said my car is directly outside, I said you can clearly see I'm heavily pregnant and have got a toddler with me in a pushchair, can you just help me carry it to the car please.

Both members of staff (WOMEN) as well! Basically, just said no, nothing we can do about it, sorry.

The humanity care and compassion just isn't there. I was so upset,
I will be taking this matter further because they can't treat customer never mind human beings
like that it's absolutely appalling.

I even told them a third time my car is in the loading bay I don't understand why you can't help me carry this box out, there reply was we can give you a trolley, even though I had a toddler and a pusher with me.

"Worst customer service in Poland . I bought 3 Pax wardrobes (including transport and assembly) online, the order was carried out by the Warsaw Janki store. One of the wardrobes was damaged, but the complaint was quickly resolved. IKEA employees came to assemble it.
Part of the assembly process involves attaching the wardrobe to the wall with dowels. The gentleman took a large drill with a large drill bit and smashed it into the wall, drilling through the wall to such an extent that a piece of several centimeters flew a distance of a meter in the next room. The pieces fell onto the office chair and, as it turned out, scratched the leather-like material. When I realized this, I informed the employee about the fact, who calmly replied ""happens"" and continued working. After a while, he said it was my fault, because I should have informed him that the wall was thin, because he thought it was wall between apartments. I will add that he could easily enter the next room, and there is no door yet, so he could measure the wall withaout any issue.
In the end, he behaved no better - he stood with his back to me and said 'I'm sorry for damaging the wall'. He wrote in the report that the wall was damaged, but the chair was not. I don't know on what basis they stated this. When they left, the chair was covered in shrapnel. I refused to sign the protocol with the content they proposed.
Of course, I filed a complaint about the service, expecting the wall to be repaired and monetary compensation for the damage to the chair. Ikea wrote back to me that they were sorry about the situation, but they were unable to help me because, quoting Ikea's letter, ""IKEA does not provide renovation and construction services"" and ""The verification of the case and the entry in the protocol after installation showed that the swivel chair was not damaged. Only a wall."" Of course, they are very sorry ""Please accept our apologies for any inconvenience you have experienced."". My first and last purchases at IKEA.

"my experience with IKEA has been an ONGOING NIGHTMARE SINCE APRIL!!! . My experience with IKEA has been an absolute nightmare since April 18 2024, It is now May 23 2024!!!!
We purchased two nightstands & had Taskrabbit come to put them together. One of the nightstands was defective so IT COULD NOT EVER BE PUT TOGETHER!!! . Although IKEA replaced it, THEY WILL NOT REFUND THE MONEY THAT WE PAID TO TASKRABBIT IN ADVANCE TO PUT THE NIGHTSTAND TOGETHER, BUT NEVER GOT PUT TOGETHER. Instead they offered a gift card which we immediately declined… THEY SENT IT ANYWAY!!! … we told them day one we wanted The money refunded to our credit card since it’s IKEA fault the item could not be put together .
NOTE: The refund we requested is only a $36 refund to our credit card. They refused not once but 7 different times with 7 different reps (one woman getting nasty telling us we got a gift card what more do we want??) She couldn’t Understand my point was THAT I DID NOT WANT THE GIFT CARD… ????
So we drove 40 miles to the store, & spoke to a SO-CALLED Supervisor named WENDY & after 40 minutes she told us she was changing the gift card over to a refund on our credit card, we just had to wait 2 wks for it to go thru. We requested a copy in writing of this, but She said there was nothing she could give us & we just had to be patient. We left the store knowing deep down in our gut we would be back! ! Well we waited the 2 weeks & as we suspected we received nothing again! so I called Corperate & Corperate informed me that No one in the store , Including Wendy the supervisor ,has the ability to give $$$ back on a credit card? !!! The only thing that they are at liberty to do is give out a gift card , PERIOD!!!! So back again, we drove 40 miles to IKEA this time to speak with an on duty manager named Jesse, who said he’d be off the next day but would PERSONALLY see to it that something got done & that we’d get a call. He took our personal info & phone number & said he would follow up & himself. ,& AGAIN WE GOT NOTHING!!!
So to wrap up …EVERY SINGLE PERSON WE HAVE DEALT WITH EITHER ON THE PHONE (telling me a supervisor would call me back & then didn’t) & IN PERSON HAS BLATANTLY LIED!!! Both Representatives & supervisors . To me that says the company itself is telling them to do this!!! How can it be every single employee is the same way???? This must be policy… “ LIE TO THE CUSTOMER AGAIN & AGAIN, THEY WILL GET TIRED & FRUSTRATED, & THEY WILL GO AWAY!!!”
ABSOLUTELY HORRIFIC, UNPROFESSIONAL OUTRAGEOUS. DISGUSTING BEHAVIOR.!!!
So sad! This company clearly has no honor , no character & no self value that they think nothing of lying to your face like they do!
I would NEVER recommend this company to anyone due to this & I would NEVER recommend their products to anyone since they don’t feel they have any responsibility in returning your money when their sub-par products cannot be put together! They obviously think people have plenty of time on their hands to sit around & wait for somebody to TRY TO put something together FOR HOURS, THEN HAVE TO WAIT FOR A NEW ITEM TO BE DELIVERED, THEN HAVE TO WAIT AGAIN FOR THE SAME PRODUCT THEY GOT THE FIRST TIME TO BE PUT TOGETHER ALL OVER AGAIN, & HAVE TO PAY FOR IT NOT ONCE BUT 2X AS WELL!!!

I am seriously considering small claims court if this review does not end with a $36 refund on our credit card!. And if I do, I will be filing for not just the the $36 Lost to taskrabbit, but also The return of both night tables .($357) I still have in my possession & THAT I WILL GLADLY RETURN . court fees,($30,) the 3 hrs of time I spent back-n-forth to IKEA ($225) ), plus whatever amount of hours I’m not working & sitting in a courtroom because of this. I get paid $75 an hour , so if court takes 3hrs wait time, IKEA would possibly be looking at a minimum bill of $836 bill when all they had to do is put $36 back to my fathers card!!! Does this make sense to anyone? ,ANYONE??, BUELLER ??? BUELLER????

Member number 6275980387768338193,
3 years ago I bought what was supposed to be high quality kitchen units with 25 year warranty, now the base corner unit double door hinge was ripped from the side wall attachment due to the base unit is made from chip wood which is not strong enough to withstand the weight of the double door.
complaints to customer service lasted several weeks as they kept asking over and over again for photos of the damage although they sent every time.
Eventually they send me a replacement base corner unit which is no good to me as I have to get the counter top and most of the kitchen units removed to replace the base corner unit. It needs a repair scheme but they said they do not do repairs although they have subcontractors who could easily do the job.
I had to pay $150 to get it repaired. The kitchen unit cabinets are of inferior quality and not worth the money. You can get cabinets made from plywood which are less than half the price and much stronger.
The 25 year warranty is not worth the paper it is written on. I would never buy any furniture from Ikea again. Just to note that the price of the units now are 50% more than what I paid then!

"IKEA BLETCHLEY . IKEA BLETCHLEY, zero stars if i could, used the Bletchley store to design PAX wardrobes in the master bedroom in a recently purchased property. the property had just been recently renovated.
the final design was ordered and paid for and a week to be delivered. loads and loads of boxes arrived and TaskRabbit were booked to erect and install the wardrobes at a cost of £420! on the day of the install i dismantled the bed and some units and moved them into the en-suite so that they had enough space to erect the 2 corner Wardrobes and chest of drawers. 5 hours later and all was complete and fixed into position by screwing into the external blockwork.
i check through the install and all looked good and worked as expected, it was a nice snug fit so the measuring had been done correctly...Once the installer had left i proceeded to re-erect the bed and slid that into position between the two wardrobes.. this is were it all starts going wrong!!
with the bed in position the wardrobe doors will not open! with the corner wardrobe you have to fully open door no1 by at least 110 degrees to be able to open the door no2, but as the bed was next to the wardrobe you could only open door no1 by 90degrees which didnt allow enough room to be able to open door no2, so now the wardrobe is effectively useless as i cant even open the doors.
Back to IKEA design department to see what they can do! and after scratching his head for 10 minutes the only solution was to apologise and tell me to go to the customer care dept and request a refund.
so feeling a bit p!55ed at this, off i went to the CCD and told them of my problem. this was not an issue and a full refund was going to be given as soon as the wardrobes were dismantled they will be collected, i asked who can dismantle them? they replied that it would be my responsibility to arrange this as it was my decision to return the wardrobes! i checked with Taskrabbit and they quoted £350 to dismantle them which IKEA had confirmed they would not refund me even though it was their mess up by designing wardrobes that would clearly not work.
after refusing the dismantling cost i dismantled them myself and the wardrobes have been collected.
once the wardrobes had been removed the damage caused to my newly decorated bedroom is horrendous with holes in the wallpaper where the units had been screwed to the wall and 6mtr sections of coving removed as the wardrobes were full height.
i emailed ikea requesting help to repair the damage cause by their mess up and all they said was i am lucky to be getting a refund! they also refused to help with the install costs of £420 which i paid out needlessly for.
if their designers had been given the correct training these errors would not happen and i wouldn't be out of pocket by £420 with also £1000 worth of damage that requires repairing due to no fault of my own.
they are a truly awful company and i will never shop at this place again..",Trustpilot_USA

I made an order of around £450 and paid the £35 express delivery since I wasn't avaliable any other day.
The next day comes, I wait for my IKEA delivery, and around 7pm I was told it was coming the next day.

Devistated and a waste of one of 52 free days a year.

So I called to have it cancelled.
First they accused me of already getting the item and had to guide them to the message THEY had sent. 💀

They didn't want to cancel it it and just wanted to send me a £15 voucher.
That's no good if I'm not in, especially with all the rain.

So after a bit of an argument about how I should be able to cancel and it being a waste of my day now along side being argued with, it got cancelled and he was sending a voucher.

Thursday comes, still no voucher, I was waiting to get it before placing another order.

I called and someone said they'll fast track I and I should be with me in 24 hours, if not call again.

It's now Sunday, I call up and before saying anything was ""Hello Sir""?
This already got my back up a little bit as it's not the usual way someone from a call centre would respond.
He couldnt find any logs of my order being canceled, who, canceled is and the voucher.
The only thing he could see was whoever fast tracked it on Thursday.
He denied any acknowledgement of last Saturday and kept saying I need to wait 7 days from the day I called which was Thursday. ""NO IT WAS SATURDAY"".
He kept telling me I've not called before then. I said I wanted to make a complaint and he said I can't until after 7 days.
At this point I got mad. It's been 8 days! 😡 I said.
I said there seems to be alot of messing with cancellations and vouchers that aren't on the books and you seem to to be in on it.
I then calmly said do you work for or represent IKEA... Silence.
I asked the same question again.
He said yes quietly...
I said so do you work for IKEA?

"Items damaged . I ordered a worktop, a divider screen, and a few other items from IKEA to redecorate my office.

The box for the worktop arrived with dirty footprints and a small hole on it. The box for the SCREEN also had footprints(!!!!) and several large holes in the cardboard.

Predictably, the worktop had a gouge in it, and the plastic panels on the screen were warped out of their frames and have permanent stress marks on them from being walked on, so one side of the screen is essentially ruined.

As for the couriers, All-star logistics, they forgot to bring in one of the items I had ordered, a MALM chest of drawers, so I had to phone them and have them come back. To their credit, they were apologetic and returned within 20 minutes, but it still shouldn't have happened, and speaks to the overall professionalism of the couriers that IKEA is working with in Ireland.

I ordered a few smaller items too (a wastepaper basket, some table legs, etc), and they weren't packed at all in the truck, they were just loose. The wastepaper basket arrived with minor scuffs along the top edges.

And would you believe it, one of the smaller items I ordered was missing (a bracket for a shelf)! I can't imagine how that happened! The courier told me that it was missing upon arrival, and said that he had put in an order for a replacement that would be delivered by DPD in 10 days. (What good is that going to do me?)

IKEA only seem to offer full returns or exchanges instead of an as-is discount, which is a huge bloody nightmare considering I've just spent the day hauling a 60lbs worktop around corners and up a spiral staircase before noticing the damage and need to get things done on a schedule.

Also, do not believe the product photos on IKEA's website for worktops. For the Ekbacken worktop, the website shows a shiny surface with the edges of the laminate well finished, but the thing in person is a textured surface with ugly thin black lines around the seams of the laminate. I'm going to have to vinyl wrap it to make it look decent. Might as well have just bought bloody particleboard and done it myself from scratch at this point.

"The drivers refused to deliver our… . Regarding Kitchen Cabinet Delivery: Our experience with the planning service and with IKEA in general has been excellent. Peak Delivery Inc. was tasked with the delivery. Upon arriving, the drivers refused to deliver our kitchen cabinets to the room we had cleared for them. It was a straight, open pathway from the truck to the cleared out space. The drivers insisted that they wanted to leave the goods in the garage, where they might be susceptible to water damage. They were going to drive away with our cabinets still in the truck, until we agreed that they could leave the goods in the garage. They said they were physically incapable of taking the boxes to the agreed upon spot. So, my husband and I started doing the heavy lifting and moved the boxes from the garage as they were placed down, to the designated room. When we asked the Peak Delivery Inc. drivers how elderly customers fare with this type of service, or how they deliver to people living in apartments, they told us that IKEA does not deliver to apartments. This was a case of complete laziness. Instead of a nice tip, they have dissatisfied customers. Well, at least we got our steps in.",Trustpilot_USA

"IKEA what a disappointment. . IKEA what a disappointment!
So me and and my little sister went through to our eldest sisters to help our eldest sister and her partner move house and help build furniture etc.

They ordered their sofa, bed and wardrobe sets etc from IKEA, spent a lot of money for them and paid extra for express delivery to be delivered next day which was meant to come Friday, to their disappointment it hadn’t shown up. So my eldest sister got on chats and calls to IKEA being told numerous different tales off of different advisors, one of the advisors which said it would be delivered Saturday between 10-2, also being told it is waiting to be dispatched. We was also told a few times Saturday morning that they would be delivered still, till we finally got through to someone again yesterday at 3/4 o’clock arguing toss with them, for him to keep sighing down the phone at us, and at this point we was farley calm with him, for him to say it will not be coming and their is nothing they can do.
So we proceeded to ask for a manager or someone a little higher up to be told numerous times he couldn’t do that, which we all know they can. We finally got put through to a team leader, as we had nothing to sleep on and one of reasons I went through was to help them build, we ended up having to get Ubers and pay out for air beds which we shouldn’t of had to do.
Then the team leader we spoke with admitted to us that the advisors on Friday and the ones Saturday morning should have known already that it wouldn’t be coming this weekend at all, so they lied to us multiple times. If they would have told them Friday they could have held off the rubbish removals and movers so they had something to sleep on.

All in all be cautious what you’re doing when ordering big items etc from IKEA because they don’t seem to give a damn and their customer advisors are absolutely useless and need more training.

And as of today, they are not delivering tomorrow either what a disgrace.",Trustpilot_USA

"PAX wardrobe anchoring nightmare . Definitely not a company that I would want to buy furniture from moving forward. We went for the pax wardrobe solution with mirror doors and do not realise that the whole wardrobe had to be anchored to the wall in order to be stable. By this I mean that the wardrobe doesn't collapse when you open the doors which is exactly what happened to us. We had to get a local specialist to come and modify the wall behind the wardrobe as this was plasterboard and ensure that the wall can take the 200 kg of load without coming down as well. Ikea did not provide any guidance or any support following our complaint.

I was under the impression that if a product requires a specific technical assembly or follow-up work that you would at least be notified so that you avoid buying that product if you're not able to anchor it in the right way. It would have helped to have a notification on the website saying that this wardrobe is not stable without complete anchoring in multiple points.

The Customer Service supervisor, Neisha, is the most disrespectful sales person I’ve met, and let me tell you… I’ve met more than a couple of incompetent self absorbed store clerks. But this person is atop, and comes with an attitude. She even declined to provide her supervisor’s name: in fact, she identified herself as the General Manager of the store. A person so blunt and lacking of basic manners and education skills… Unbelievable! After leaving the store, I called IKEA’s Customer Service, and an agent by the name of Brian not only told me that he didn’t have a supervisor either, but declined to provide a physical or email address to write a complaint. I’m still asking myself if he is, indeed, an Earthlink. Afterwards, I googled and learned that IKEA not only has one of the worst customer service ratings, but that the quality of their products is subpar and are also known for unethical and illegal practices around the world. So, hey IKEA, thank Neisha for saving me a couple of thousand $ by not spending them in the stones and sticks you sell.

"BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE MANAGER . I recently had the most disheartening and frustrating experience at IKEA Warrington, one that starkly highlights a grave lapse in the quality of customer service that one would expect from a brand of such repute. I approached the customer service desk with a simple request for a refund, an issue that should have been resolved swiftly and with minimal fuss. Instead, what I encountered was a staff that not only lacked the basic tenets of customer service but also exhibited an arrogance and dismissiveness that escalated a simple matter into an unnecessary confrontation.

It is utterly appalling that in a customer-facing role, the staff at IKEA Warrington would choose to be not just unhelpful but outright abusive towards customers. Their behavior was not only unprofessional but also indicative of a disturbing lack of empathy and understanding. To be met with such arrogance and to have a straightforward issue turn into an argument speaks volumes of the dire need for a significant overhaul in their customer service training and attitude.

I am deeply disappointed and shocked at the level of disdain shown towards customers. This experience has not only soured my view of IKEA Warrington but has also made me question the values and customer service ethos that IKEA purports to uphold. It is imperative that this matter be addressed with the utmost seriousness and that significant measures are taken to ensure that no other customer has to endure such an appalling experience. The staff in question should be held accountable, and a thorough review of customer service practices at IKEA Warrington is urgently needed to prevent such incidents in the future.",Trustpilot_USA

When there are no problems, you get cheap, mass-produced products which may do you fine. When you get delivered a damaged item, there is NO RESPECT FOR DECENCY, they promise to replace the damaged (paid for) item but do not do so. I ordered two pieces of furniture Feb 15 which were delivered Feb 20, one fine, the other obviously fallen off a lorry or dropped in transit, corner of packaging squashed and torn. Just looking at the corner I could see it was broken so opened a little more. Immediately submitted request for replacement and pick up of damaged goods. Was surprised they didn't even ask for photos but said they would exchange on Feb 28. I asked for earlier but no, this was the date, they said. Feb 27 I had not had a confirmation of a window smaller than 7-19, so I contacted customer service. They said no, it would not be delivered on 28, as the goods were not in the UK yet; delivery required another week, and would be on March 6. By now deeply suspicious, I called on March 5 to request confirmation delivery really would take place the following day but no, they ""couldn't see any record"" of the order, so issued a new one (but what about the complaint and request for replacement from the original order? What about the new order number given for the supposed Feb 28 delivery??)
I have no reason to believe that the latest ""new order"" (funny ha ha, when I have been waiting since Feb 15 for this article!!)will be fulfilled any more than those of others who have written of similar experiences. So I wondered whether they have a supply chain issue, or are about to stop making the very widely sold ALEX series..... but no, if I order the article tonight and pay for it, I can get express delivery on March 9 or normal delivery on March 11. HOW COME IKEA CANNOT REPLACE A FULLY PAID DAMAGED ARTICLE IN LESS THAN A MONTH, BUT WILL SUPPLY A NEW ONE IF PAID AGAIN IN 1-3 DAYS??? THIS IS NOTHING BUT DELIBERATE KEEPING OF MONEY WITHOUT DELIVERING GOODS. I will complain to consumer organizations and also see if my bank can reverse the card payment made.

Had a online kitchen plan appointment with Karolina Duda and was a very bad experience as she got my order wrong two times then customer service advised me to go in and sort it out in person so decided to go to IKEA Thurrock but had a similar experience with a lady called Natalia Kokun very aggressive and pushy lady. Finally and thankfully my appointment got taken over by Jane the manager and I put my order through and was sorted. Overall not happy with the poor service and knowledge of some of the IKEA designers as it’s very hard to communicate with some of them. Natalia Kokun even said me “one of the original designer Jose Martinez Gonzalez that design my kitchen from scratch is not necessarily right with his plan” as I found that very unprofessional to say something like that about her colleague. But Jose was best and super good at planning my kitchen. Unfortunately Jose was no longer available and not working for ikea so had to go through all these unprofessional women.,Trustpilot_USA
"Wrong delivery over and over and over . Ok. This is my experience. I went into the IKEA store at Logan to build a cabinet on the computer. This was done ok, but I wanted it delivered and built. They didn't have have all the parts and told me to buy a couple to take home and avoid delay. So I did. Just two, that's ok. The items were delivered at the right date besides two pieces that were incorrect. After the builder (who was amazing) built it, they said two drawer cover parts were too small. So, I sat online (for ages) waiting for someone to talk to about it. After a lengthy process, they agreed to exchange the two pieces via delivery. But this wasnt before asking if I'd prefer to just go in and exchange them. Well, no, because it's 40 minutes away and I paid for delivery. Just deliver the right parts. So, the order was created and they had the nerve to say, you won't need to pay for these since it was our fault, consider it gesture of goodwil. Like excuse me? When they issued me the order after I stopped the chat, I read it and it was incorrect. They were issuing a replacement for exact same parts. Fml. So, I went back onto the chat and did the same process. They then did it correctly. The drivery wasn't coming for a week, but that day came and no one showed up. So, again, I went through the lengthy chat process only to be told they didn't pick it up. Well fk me right. So, I did the online chat again! They issued another order for another week later. I was travelling in the area and thought, maybe should just drop in (the day before delivery) to save the hassle and get them myself, and cancel the delivery. No, they could that, it was too hard. Wow, what a great system. They did say, but if they don't deliver them again, you can come in. Oh yes please! Not now while it's convenient for everyone, after the fact. So, true to their word, the delivery came. I opened it up, and you wouldn't believe it. They gave me the wrong colour. The wrong fkn colour. You can only guess what I need to do now. There is definitely some special people and systems at IKEA.",Trustpilot_USA

"Ikea is a lie . After furnishing almost the whole house with furniture from you, on the last order with the number 1408572238, I encountered problems with a delay in shipping for almost a month. After several calls to the call center, I was promised, as compensation, a voucher of approximately €50 (!!!), immediately in the following days. But, that voucher never came. Whenever I called to ask about the voucher, I was first told that the voucher did not exist but because i insist, they will provide it for me. Like ""Look how good and generous we are!""

Since I didn't think it was appropriate for you to promise something and then not keep your word, I informed Ikea that I will file a complaint with the Consumer Protection Authority. But the Authority asks me for proof of the voucher promise. I returned to Ikea Romania and asked for recorder phone calls and I was refused.

All the time when I returned with the phones in the call center I was lied to in the same way: the voucher does not exist but you will receive it in a day or two, at the latest. A week has passed since the last call!!!

I am very disappointed with this company...

the customer service chatguy assured us, we don`t have to bother about that email, we got a same one today as well. after 40 min we finally get another chatguy, who told us our complain is still in progress and we have to give it 7-10 days to got the missing items (the first guy told us 48-72 hours to solve the problem, the second told another 24-48 hours, now its 7-10days) and also told us again, we don`t have to worry about those mails. after 3 times talking to the customer service and 6 days already gone, i`m curious when we gonna get our missing selves if ever.

"No more sofas from Ikea . Very bad experience with Ikea service and product.
We got a Kivik sofa 6 years ago and Ikea stated a 10 year warranty on its sofa. It specifically stated that cuscions/pillows and frames are included in the warranty. False.
Sofa and pillows caved in. And we were getting back pain. We brought the sofa back to the store as it was of no use to us at that state.
At Ikea store they refused us the warranty stating that these kinds of defects are specifically excluded from warranty by some internal document that was absolutely impossible to show to us. So we repeatedly asked to give us the proof of that statement in written form. The person who was at customer service desk and than his “manager” refused to show it. Therefore promised 10 year warranty appeared to have no real value.
We called Ikea support. Yet we heard the same answer. We can not provide you with the written proof of misterious exception from the warranty.
We consulted the site of Ikea. Product is positioned as a good quality and long lasting with good resistance to normal use, citation “Door de stevige pocketvering behoudt de bank zijn vorm en blijft hij comfortabel, jaar in jaar uit.”
Kivic sofa did not keep the shape and it was not comfortable as stated. In another document Ikea states
“…..What is covered under this limited warranty?
This limited warranty applies to domestic use only and covers defects in material and workmanship in the following components: • frames
• seat and back cushions
in the following products:
…
• KIVIK seating series
…” closing citation.

And than one little add up “IKEA will examine the product and decide, at its sole discretion, if it is covered under this limited warranty….”.
So seemingly Ikea stated that it sells a nice quality product and it is ready to increase a normal 2 year warranty up to 10 years for how good it is and yet it will decide if it actually does that at its convinience.
So you buy it on misleading information and get into a deal you maybe otherwise would not ever conclude. You loose your money and you do not have a usable product. We have spent thousands of euro in Ikea products and closed eyes on minor things. But this one is gross.
We started checking online and apparently we were not the only ones to have an issue with the same product.
So my question is : Is it a willingly omitted information to induce consumer to buy something he otherwise would not buy? If this defect is known to this product then why isn’t it specifically stated to beware of this issue. Why is refusal of warranty based on some kind of secret internal document?
The sofa is rather expensive, is it just a hunt for a profit and promotion of sales on base of deceipt? We would not buy the sofa if we would know that it has such quality issues and such post-sales support.
We were the only users of sofa. We have the original bill. The defects that we discovered are clearly and expressively covered for the type of defect and the product itself. And yet we can not get to any solution.
I guess a common action with this regard would be the best thing to do with other people who had the same issue.
Ps. Chatting with client support was also not specifically useful. First person just like with call dropped from chat. Second one gave us an email which we used to send a complaint. That will 99.9999% end up with no real reply or solution.",Trustpilot_USA

Anyways, just to mention a few things regarding the brand itself, their billy bookcases and malm bed frames are quite nice, i might say. The assembly process was a bit of a challenging puzzle. But frankly tho, there is a weird kind of satisfaction that comes with it after you put it all together, kinda like an adult lego you know.

"IKEA Cancelled their 5% in-store discount. Major downgrade and deems the membership close to pointless. . I cant believe companies continue to shrink customer benefits especially towards loyal customers then spin it like it’s supposed to make us happy.

They made it seem like they were giving people some crazy discount; in the grand scheme of business, it means nothing to IKEA but now lower income people like myself no longer have small savings. Plus it renders the entire card useless because I don’t use it for any reason besides the discount. Now I have another plastic card stashed in the landfill amongst millions of others.

"Frustrating Experience with IKEA PAX System and Bestä Cabinet Delivery . I recently ordered the PAX system and Bestä cabinet from IKEA, with a total cost of around 7000€. The delivery process turned out to be a significant disappointment, leaving me with a mix of frustration and inconvenience.

The delivery was divided into 5 shipments, and immediately, issues arose. One of the deliveries has been stuck for a month due to a problem in the IKEA system. This forced me to contact customer service and request a refund, adding an unnecessary hassle to the overall experience.

Another delivery contained only a single glass door, which arrived with a noticeable crack in the corner. While this was certainly inconvenient, it paled in comparison to the most disappointing delivery of all. This particular shipment included a whopping 70 items. The delivery team worked so swiftly that I couldn't count the packages in real-time. However, upon closer inspection the next days, it became apparent that six crucial packages, including core components for the PAX and Bestä, were missing, along side few grffs while they were mentioned in the delivery note of that shipments.

This forced me to reorder the missing items to complete the assembly process, causing delays and added expenses. The situation highlighted the need for customers to meticulously verify every piece of their delivery, as missing components can lead to significant setbacks. This task becomes even more daunting when considering the delivery cost, which was already a substantial 370€.

"I'm deeply disheartened and frustrated… . I'm deeply disheartened and frustrated with the entire experience of ordering made-to-measure wardrobes from IKEA. Despite being a long-time and high-value customer both in-store and online, the service I've encountered has been shocking.

Over the course of December and early January, I attended three in-store planning service appointments, providing precise measurements for a 'L' corner unit wardrobe in the bedroom, shelving units for the living room, and a set of chest drawers – all totaling over £1000.00. After a considerable wait for a delivery date, I received my order on January 14th.

Professional assembly took place on January 16th, revealing a significant error in the measurements of the bedroom wardrobe corner unit, despite multiple face-to-face appointments to prevent such mistakes. Additionally, one of the living room shelves was chipped. That evening, I contacted IKEA customer services via telephone and faced three disconnections after expressing my concerns.

When I finally reached an advisor, a complaint was raised for the chipped shelf, and I was directed to return to the store and speak with a manager about the bedroom wardrobe error. The next day, I visited the store, and while the manager was amicable, the proposed solution involved collecting excess furniture, providing missing hinges and assembly of one door outstanding, and replacing the chipped shelf. There was no mention of compensation or the replacement of the wardrobes with the originally planned design. I am now left with a wardrobe unit that deviates significantly from my intended design, offering less storage space than desired.

"Scam, shocking experience, file a claim . I ordered a PAX wardrobe for 1400€, with delivery fees of 129€ included. The delivery was scheduled for January 8, 2024, between 4 PM and 8 PM, but it never arrived. We called customer service, who told us to opt for an ""express"" delivery to be delivered the next day, which cost us an additional 10€. The customer service agent said that we would be refunded and receive a commercial gesture once the order was received. The order was supposed to arrive on January 10, 2024, between 10 AM and 2 PM; it never did. We called customer service again, who told us that the agent had made a mistake and should never have offered an ""express"" delivery, as the telephone customer service was not authorized to do so.

Therefore, we had to reschedule a ""normal"" delivery for January 14, 2024, between 8 AM and 10 AM. It was a Sunday! We received the order at 8 AM.

I later called customer service again, who told me that they could not refund the ""express"" delivery as there was no record of it, only the shipping fee of 129€. No other compensation! We took 3 days of paid leave, waited a week for the order, received the order on a Sunday, and paid for express delivery.

Appalling customer service and delivery . Second time I ordered a piece of furniture for delivery and it was not delivered on the day they said it would. I received no updates and at the end of the day when I finally found a number I could call and after hanging on for 20 minutes I was told it would not be delivered that day. They offered me another date 5 days later and a £20 voucher. They couldn’t guarantee it would be delivered on the second date either. Management of delivery is appalling and their customer service to rectify things gone wrong is just as bad. No empathy and a token £20 voucher. I would expect at least a refund of the delivery charge. They really couldn’t care less!,Trustpilot_USA
"Too hard to find things, good value . I want to give a higher review, but I just can't. Okay, we love their products, and when it's in stock and findable, the value is good on most items. But the store is *daunting* to visit, and the website is obtuse about what is in stock, and how to find some items. Or you'll put everything into your cart and then get to a screen telling you that what you wanted isn't available after all, and getting you to remove the items to proceed. Requesting a notification for when an item comes back in stock is also not intuitive. Staff are mostly friendly in the stores, some are very helpful, but it's a marathon visiting them or ordering online.",Trustpilot_USA

"IKEA For many decades . IKEA For many decades, IKEA stores around the world have offered furniture at very attractive prices. Last year, accusations surfaced in Germany that during communism, IKEA made a lot of money by using forced labor of prisoners in the German Democratic Republic, which was the name of the state established after World War II in the Soviet occupation zone in Germany.
According to the documents of the Stasi, the East German security service, this practice began in the 1960s and lasted almost until the end of the GDR, which in 1990 reunited with the Federal Republic of Germany, established in the territories of Germany occupied by Western powers.Nazism is eternally alive in October's IKEA. Its founder belonged to the Nazi party, and political prisoners of the GDR worked as slaves in IKEA factories.IKEA has a long tradition of oppressing and doing business with totalitarian regimes. After a Catholic was fired from his job in Krakow, the gloomy past of a Swedish seller and furniture manufacturer of shreds is recalled.Swedish journalist Elisabeth Åsbrink, describing the history of the October giant, revealed in 2011 that its founder Ingvar Kamprad was an activist of the Swedish Nazi party.The Swedish services collected information about him and classified him as a Nazi. In 1942, when millions of Europeans were being murdered and the final plan for the Holocaust was being prepared, Kamprad joined Svensk Socialistisk Samling, which was the successor of the Swedish National Socialist Labor Party - the equivalent of the German NSDAP.Earlier reports of his Nazi activity appeared in 1994, when letters were found revealing that the later founder of the Nazi empire was involved in recruiting for the Nazi organization and supporting it financially. Kamprad also never commented on the allegations that he belonged to the Nordic Youth, the equivalent of the German Hitlerjugend.
These were not just the mistakes of youth. In the early 1970s, IKEA established very close cooperation with the communist fascist regime in the GDR. The October giant built its factories there and used the slave labor of political prisoners. One of the plants was built near the prison in Waldheim.
According to Hans Otto Klare, who was convicted of trying to get to West Germany, it was ""slave labor"". Prisoners slept on the upper floor of the factory, and production took place downstairs. Political prisoners worked downstairs without any protection - without gloves, headphones to protect against noise, they did not even have a place to sit for a moment. Conditions were much worse than in other communist plants.",Trustpilot_USA
"Bought IKEA kitchen from Vejle studio . Bought IKEA kitchen from Vejle studio. As per recommendation we provided dimensions to order bordplade. Signed papers given by ikea , paid and all done. We have the drawings to carpenter to fix cabins as per bordplade dimensions.

Few days later , received call from ikea employee that he made a mistake. And he has changed some dimensions. He pushed us to sign right away as change is small and will be no issue. We disagreed and insisted we can’t sign without understanding change. We were told there is no meeting slot available before Wednesday and our delivery will be late. We showed flexibility and said late delivery is ok but we can’t sign without knowing change. We were told it’s ok and let’s meet on Wednesday 10 Jan 2024.

First surprise - found many options available on Monday 8 Jan 2024 to meet and we wondered why we were not offered earlier option to meet ?

Second surprise - got a call from IKEA to provide account number. We were told we cancelled the order and ikea wants to return us money. I explained - No we didn’t cancel order and how we can do that ? It’s Ikea mistake and they wanted to change that we want to discuss . We are fine to get what we paid for without any changes. No change is from
Our side. Person on phone was not listening and just want account to return money. She was not concerned about actual situation

On request , an order cancellation email was sent. And it didn’t say who told them to cancel order ? And IKEA also don’t want to return 800 kr delivery charges. Really ? What’s our fault in this ? IKEA made mistake , ikea decided to cancel order and made 800 out of this .. seriously ? Is it really ikea ?

I am shocked as I never ever assumed this is how things work at Ikea .. I was at way different expectation level that I decided to buy expensive kitchen from Ikea despite a good offer from a designer brand ( offer can be presented if anyone in doubt )

"Lies, mistakes and silence . We ordered two kitchens with IKEA Amsterdam. Maybe it's reassuring to know that we, as colleagues are treated just as terribly as other customers.

We paid in full for our kitchens in July 2023. We were required to have a measurement service to have Kasker countertops ordered. The lead times suggested in store were significantly shorter than the reality quoted. In the end we did one kitchen with Kasker and one with custom wood counters. Both kitchens were a disaster and are still not fully installed (it's almost January 2024).

For the kitchen with wooden counters:
1. IKEA didn't show up to deliver half the kitchen (was more than a week delayed with no communication and me having to call over and over because no one called or emailed me back). This cost additional bills with the installers. (Out of pocket more than €6k with all the issues)
2. Kitchen didn't include the plans (by email, in the kitchen planner or in print). We later got these 2 weeks later.
3. IKEA told us to send a comaint email and gave a deadline (in September) they still haven't responded despite followups
4. The wooden counters were warped and couldn't be installed flat.
5. The measurement service didn't measure the entire room and was inaccurate (why force us to take a service and not fully provide it?)
6. Items included in the original order that were paid for went out of stock and are supposed to be delivered. No one has followed up. No refund is recieved.

The kitchen with Kasker counters:
1. Had ongoing delays due to lack of communication between ikea, the delivery company, the counter company and the installers - we were required to use their installation partner.
2. The sink in the kitchen counter was damaged so couldn't be installed. We were told someone would contact us to fix a new date but it's been 3 months and no one calls us back. We have a full stone work counter sitting on the floor in the way and causing damage to the floor because no one has bothered to follow-up.
3. There were missing items in the order. The installer said he'd have IKEA deliver them but because they were late we'd have to install them ourselves. We still haven't received these items.
4. IKEA sent one guy to install the entire kitchen. He was nice but from an external company and needed help because he couldn't lift things on his own. We were told we had to pay for their installer and wouldn't be allowed to use our own installers... but then needed to get additional help.
5. The IKEA kitchen planning staff missed multiple things in this order meaning there are all sorts of exposed screw fittings were cover panels should have been recommended

I'm shocked that two orders could both be such disasters. Mistakes happen but for IKEA Amsterdam to lie to us and avoid following up again and again is shocking. As a colleague, it's difficult to continue to work for a company that treats its customers like this.",Trustpilot_USA

The 12 i got a call from the driver to send the location were to drive to, exactly like the first time. I did send location, but than instantly i received an email from Ikea delivery failed!!
Called back the driver, he did not pick up the phone.
Called customer service, after 35 minutes i got an very friendly guy on the the phone, i explained everything, ha called the delivery company and they told the van broke down. That is precise what i thought they would tell. Next delivery would be 21th. The nice guy told me that was not acceptable and he would get an earlier day to deliver.
Whole house is up side down because we had to clear the bedroom to build the new closet.
Anyway new date became 16th, that was nice still everything done before X-mas, we are having guests over for a couple of days.
16th in the morning call from delivery driver, please send location, thats what they do when living in the campo.

I said that we needed it today, but when I was told this i not possible I asked that they please arrange for 23rd and I would also like to raise this as a formal complaint as the service has not been good.

Agent Sabah then decided to rudely end the chat without either logging the complaint or rearranging the collection, stating that I was away from the chat - even though the last message was from me saying ""ok"" when they said they would log the complaint for me.

Over here Ikea employees are having a protest until the 13.12.23 so all service stations are down. An exchange and getting the missing items was impossible. My dad did wait 2 1/2hours in line to just get told that this is something Ikea can't help with atm.

Due to me having health related issues all the work fell in the leps of my family. Not being able to finish something you started and wasting your time to wait in line are things that are very stressful on all involved. But we understand that people are fighting for what they need.

Thankfully a call center customer care employee by the name Mr. T. Niebusch (IKEA Germany) was very understanding and helped us out by placing a delivery of the missing and damaged items to be received at my home.

We are very grateful. The scheduled delivery was the best solution.

So they charged me to make these returns. You can never speak to a supervisor. They had to deliver 21 cabinet doors before I received 4 that were not damaged. All these deliveries required me to be home in a 4-hour window. They never read or respond to any reviews. Protect yourself.",Trustpilot_USA

The plate with 8 meatballs (which meanwhile were 14 in the years before) had a price of $ 9.49 before taxes. The plate was almost empty: half a scoop masched potatoes ( not even full scoop) , tastless peas ( about 2 table spoons ) thrown in the middle of the plate, teaspoon cranberry sauce and 8 meatballs. Looked bad. Higher price, less food, no visual appearance. Was the staff new, was the person that served that not experienced or the store policy changed? I do not know.

"Annoying minor faults caused extra visits and costs . Having shopped for many years at Ikea, (mostly at Wednesbury) as have most of our grownup family, we have usually been delighted with our purchases, including self-assembled furniture for every part of the houses we have lived in.
However the last purchase, a small BESTA, was a disappointment and involved 3 extra journeys of quite a few miles to sort out the problem. We then emailed Customer Services and received our requested compensation for fuel and inconvenience, and CS were fair for which we thank them, but could have resolved quicker.
We do, however, wonder if the quality of some of the ranges have lessened in an attempt to keep costs down.",Trustpilot_USA

"Rude Customer Service Manager at IKEA Milton Keynes . When I was living in Ireland I have been buying some of my furnitures from IKEA at least for 4 years, and I did not have any problem. When I moved to the UK, I thought my experience would be the same but unfortunately, it was not.
On 11.11.2023, I bought IKEA PAX from IKEA Milton Keynes and set the delivery date as 25.11.2023. On the delivery date, I received the tracking link and then the driver called me to notify that he will be at the house in an hour. After 30 minutes, he called me back to tell me that he cannot do the delivery because he does not have enough battery in the van! I told him that as long as my order is delivered before Monday, it is okay with me and he agreed to do the delivery on Sunday morning. On Sunday morning, I received an email from IKEA saying that my new delivery date is the next Thursday (30.11.2023). The problem is I hired somebody to come and do custom fitting for me on Monday (27.11.2023) morning 1 month ago and I could not postpone it or cancel it. So I called the customer service and explained my situation. They could not do anything but they told me that it might be helpful for me to go IKEA Milton Keynes and talked to the customer service there. So I went there and had the worst experience with the customer service manager at IKEA Milton Keynes.
First, I talked to a nice lady in the customer service. She tried to find a solution but when I noticed that she always has to talk to her manager, I asked her if I can talk to the customer service manager directly.
I explained the situation to her and ask for a solution. She said the delivery was not done on Saturday because the delivery address was wrong(!). So it is my fault. I asked her to check the previous and the new delivery addresses because they are the same and I explained the real reason is the low battery of the van. She said these things can happen. I told her that I need a solution becuase it is not my fault. She said I can collect the order from the store but the order is nearly 400kg, according to the invoice. I told her that if I can, I would do it when I bought my PAX on 11.11.2023. She said she can cancel the order and provide full refund. But I need a wardrobe and I have already booked a person for fitting the wardrobe, so I also refused that. She said then I should wait Thursday for the delivery. I did not want to accept that because it is not my fault and I arranged everything in advance. So I asked her to arrange a delivery on Monday morning because I cannot cancel or postpone my appointment with my builder but she refused to do that. Then I asked her if she can guaratee a delivery on Thursday. She said she is ""almost sure"" because now they have the correct address. I reminded her that the address was correct and that was not the problem and her reply was she is ""almost sure"" for the delivery. Then I asked her to compensate my loss due to cancelling my builder, if I accept the new delivery date. She told me she could do it if I had booked a builder that they suggested. But for my situation, she refused to compensate and offer 30 pounds(!) discount voucher. When I asked her if she truely believes 30 pounds is enough to compensate everything, including all the stress that I had to face, all the additional expenses that I have to do and all the time I spent to drive to Milton Keynes, in a mocking tone she said they cannot compensate the time I lost and the stress that I had, and 30 pounds is the maximum she can offer. And finally, she said unless I want to cancel my order, there is nothing that I can do there and I can leave(!).
I am not sure how successful I was to explain my disappointment at the rudeness of the IKEA Milton Keynes customer service manager, but I did my best to explain the situation. I can't forget the sarcasm in her voice. I hope someone at IKEA sees this and takes action.",Trustpilot_USA

"Bad in-store system for kitchen items, horrible customer care . We went to the store in Draper UT, and had a horrible experience due to their pull system for kitchen items resulting in a 45 minutes for two items! (Make a line for 20+ item and under 20 item orders if you HAVE to have all kitchen items treated that way. There is no reason a customer cannot take a simple drawer off the shelf themselves...) So, as the store was a ""never again"" experience, we ordered online with scheduled delivery. Big mistake. IKEA delivered an order of two kitchen cabinets with a door missing. I was lied to by the delivery people that the missing piece would be sent out the same day. When I went to my account and saw no acknowledgement of a missing piece, I contacted customer ""care"". Nobody was aware the door was missing. Then, I was told I will have to wait 10 days for the missing door! Next, after getting disconnected from customer care chat, I was sent an invoice by email stating that I need to pay $17 before the missing door will be sent!! Unacceptable! It is their mistake!  
So I had to go back to customer care chat, explain everything all over again. When I told them that having to wait 10 days was not acceptable, I was told to just go to the store myself to get what I needed. And then I was just disconnected. So I called customer care on the phone (their menu does not work properly!) When I finally talked to a person in customer care, I only received a snarky chuckle and ""what are you gonna do? It sucks to be you"" type of reaction. When I told her that nobody has shown any concern for my experience, that there is not the least attempt to make this truly right, I only got attitude and ""your problem"". When you ask these customer care agents to talk to a manager, it is clear IKEA does not want you to complain about how you are treated. Bad experience made worse by horrible customer ""care"". IKEA simply does not care. Don't have your representatives laugh at your customer's inability to be treated right. It left a weird ""abuse of power"" feeling.

I said your point of sales states if unhappy you could bring your purchase back 365 days after purchase. I brought my purchase back only a couple of days after purchase. I asked why at point of sale it did not state refunds are not given if a package is opened even if not suitable or a problem, I was greeted with terms are on the website.But I said I bought in store not on line so therefore your terms are not stated at point of sale. The staff smirked at me behind customer services and seemed to get a kick out of not issuing refunds.

Absolutely shocking. We paid £40 for delivery on a saturday and it never turned up with no notice. We stayed in all day and cancelled plans to accommodate for it. We werent offered any refund for the FORTY pounds delivery. All we were offered was a £20 voucher. Why would we ever order from here again with such a shocking delivery service?

Their excuse was that 1 item out of the order wasnt in stock. So they didnt bother? No notice? No partial delivery with a refund?

We werent able to talk to anybody else at the customer service team as they didnt have the capacity, therefore they seem to be lacking management or supervision too. It shows how much they care about customer service.

£40 for an order that never arrived! I cant believe it. And again, 0 communication. It takes 5 minutes to call or text or set up an auto text that somebody at the warehouse could send to let us know that we don’t need go stay in the house 7-7. We couldnt even call customer service on the day as the wait time was over an hour.",Trustpilot_USA
"Why do I keep wasting my time trying to re-order . Placed order online, in stock and delivery to local Tesco store available and payment confirmed. Next day order cancelled and refund issued (not by me!). Repeated procedure and lo and behold cancelled again. I have today spent 45 mins including holding, being told this happens if issue with stock or payment which they confirmed was not the issue in both instances. Would speak to team leader if I could hold, unfortunately then cut off!!!! Really do want item so re-ordered opening an account and different payment method so we will wait and see.
I was tempted to just place order and pay for delivery but don't see why I should pay £40 for delivery when it is offered to Tesco. Any feedback from IKEA would be welcome as I have no wish to phone again and by the by the chat to a co-worker is not working, they too seem to be busy. I would love to be busy assembling my item.
UPDATE - third time order placed today, used different payment method which was approved and also opened IKEA account. What a waste of time no less than 7 hrs later again order cancelled and refund issued. Please get your act in gear, this is useless I now have to consider (as I want this item) whether to pay £40 and see if they will see the order through or spend even more time on the phone just to get cut off. Please contact me IKEA.",Trustpilot_USA

"AND NO RESOLUTION . On 9/23/23, I called to arrange the return of this item and spoke to Hassan. He processed the pick up and told me I can schedule it or any day I wanted. Being that I ordered the sofa version of uppland for delivery on 10/7, I asked him if I can schedule the pick up/return for 10/6/23. He said yes, and told me that he scheduled the pick up for that date, and I needed to call anytime before the 6th to pay a nominal fee (he said likely $60 USD.)

I called the next week to process payment, and was notified the fee was $199. I was also told by the agent I spoke to that there was NOT a scheduled pick up for that date, and that was not how the pick up was arranged.. She informed me that pick up was arranged AFTER I made payment, and that I would receive a call within 72 hours for scheduling pick up of the loveseat. (contradicting Hassan.)

After the 72 hour mark -- not receiving a call -- I called AGAIN (10/4) and was told by another agent that Ikea did NOT call to schedule the pickup, but that I had to call to schedule the pickup. (contradicting the last 2 agents.) While this woman was helping me, she put me on hold for TWENTY minutes, and then the call was disconnected.

I called back, and while reviewing this with a male agent, I was transferred mid-sentence to the closest Connecticut store to leave a message for Rebecca at the New Haven office resolution department.

Rebecca returned my call, but told me she could not assist me and passed the ball to another agent, who she said would be calling me the next day.

I did receive a call the next day from another male agent, who left a voicemail for me telling me he could not help me and to call the 888-888 phone number.

This is a pattern of terrible customer service, ineptitude, and blatant disregard for a customer who has spent thousands over the last several months furnishing my new home. All to arrange pick up of a loveseat.

Thankfully, pickup was arranged (without calling me, so the date did not work.). I called today and spoke to agent Deena, who graciously and promptly arranged for a new date, which hopefully processed without error.

I'm furious at the lack of care involved in this transaction. I strongly recommend you look into how these agents handled this experience, since no one seems to know how to process a return, as I was given many different scenarios that all contradicted each other.",Trustpilot_USA
"IKEA is awful . Over priced mediocre fake furniture with industry worst customer service. I purchased 3 bedroom pieces. One of the faces of two draw nightstand was chipped so I reached out and they said they would send a replacement. Nearly two weeks later it arrives in an oversized box with zero protection so of course one of the corners was blown out. I called and was left on hold for 10 minutes B4 hanging up and calling again. The next rep left me on hold for 9 minutes until I hung up and called again. The third rep was clueless but at least didn't leave me on indefinite hold. I had basically given up and was ready to return everything but upon being informed I'd have to disassemble everything I reluctantly agreed to wait for a replacement of the replacement. That took 16 minutes, that's 35 minutes today, plus two prior calls to get first replacement and check status of. So moral of the story is IKEA SUCKS and don't start assembling until you checked every piece, than wait for replacement before assembling in case they keep failing you, your still free to return their trash furniture.",Trustpilot_USA
"Really bad experience . I've just moved to a new apartment that has no furniture. So, my family and I trusted that Ikea could help us having a great experience furnishing and decorating our home.
However, we had a few troubles with the biggest order (in price and quantity of items).

The first problem was the delivering, the first attempt did not happen. The driver/courier went to a wrong address (I guess he was in another similar building close to mine based on the photos he showed us). He tried to call me but I was at work and in a meeting, so I couldn't answer the call. But if he had come to the correct address, he would see a sticker close to our bell containing my wife's phone number, and could complete the deliver successfully. I had to call the driver and Ikea to request another attempt of delivering as soon as possible. As I said before, my apartment has no furniture, so every day counts. Hopefully, Ikea allowed a second attempt at the same day.

But, that's when the second problem begins. The driver/courier wasn't happy with this outcome.
So, they were NOT careful with our items/packages. My wife reported they basically dropped the packages careless at the floor.

Finally, but not a surprise at all, we had the third problem. A lot of packages got damage, and three items were affected. Sadly, we only saw all the damage when we were assembling the furniture. For example, the back part of my daughter's wardrobe is severely damaged in at least four places. It seems it was threw from a higher place or maybe it hit something hard.
The other two damaged items have some small damage and other kind of marks on them.

In summary, now we have two already assembled wardrobes that got marks on them.
And another one half assembled that cannot be used.

We already raised a claim on Ikea Customer Portal twice (yes, and they did not reply yet). Moreover, there is no option to replace only the damage parts. So, we kind were obligated to use the two items that less damage, and request the replacement of our daughter's wardrobe that is severely damaged. My daughter's clothes are still in a travel luggage since our home country.",Trustpilot_USA

"DON'T DO AN IKEA KITCHEN . I am doing a kitchen remodel with IKEA cabinets and appliances and it has been the most stressful, time consuming, and horrible customer service experience that I can remember. They have charged me over $1500 for items they didn't send from my original order that were ALREADY PAID FOR and sent several items more than once and charged me for each of them as well.

I started by designing the kitchen with someone online. DO NOT DO THIS. I thankfully decided I should go in to check on everything. When I went in the person I worked with at the East Palo Alto store in northern California explained that so much was wrong with the design that she had to go through it all to correct the dimensions and replace and change items that were ordered.

I was grateful very for her time and after several hours together and a payment for all of the items on my shopping list except for 9 items that were placed on a waitlist I thought I was finished. BEWARE, your waitlist items are for you to find. I had to call over and over again to try and locate them. I did that and after two weeks was finally told that two of the items were no longer made by IKEA and that a replacement SHOULD be coming in 2024.

They sold me this kitchen design in early September. That meant I couldn't finish my cabinets. I searched and found them at other stores, but they said their policy does not allow for transfers between stores. No one seemed to care that they sold me a kitchen plan that could not be completed.

My original items for delivery were promised in 2 shipments, one on a Sat so I didnt miss another day of work. They were finally sent in different 5 deliveries that I had to be home for with a window of 24 hours each until they texted that morning with a 4-hour window.

I had to keep track of what was still missing and make endless calls that included hold times of over an hour each time just to be told they would be sent separately. When I finally thought I had all of the items, my cabinet guy went through them and made a list of what was still missing based on my original receipt.

I called the kitchen resolutions dept, as instructed, and after 9 hours on the phone over several days begging to talk to a supervisor (one was never available) I cried and they sent me through to a very nice gentleman who had a woman named Amber call me back.

We spoke for 3.5 hours just that night as I explained what I had gone through. She said it was the worst customer service experience she had ever encountered and was so sorry. She said that she'd be happy to send the stuff over but indicated that I would have to pay for it again in order to get the items here asap (I had paid contractors doing nothing based on the precise schedule I was given by IKEA) but that Id be called within 24 hours and refunded for all of it right away. She gave me her extension and I thought I was finally through with the nightmare. I was so wrong. The endless stress and frustration continued and has gone on for about a month now.

Ive tracked my calls with them and I'm up to 18.5 hours either explaining my case and relisting the items still missing as well as the ones they sent twice without my request and charged me for anyway. Each time I was promised that I would get a call within 24 to 48 hours. I have now been promised that eight times and laugh when they say it. No one has ever called.

When I tried to reach out to the helpful Amber to tell her I did not get my refund I was told over and over again that they can't call extensions from their customer service lines and no one should have told me that and that they had no idea who she was. I emailed her several times. She ghosted me. Never heard back.

In the meanwhile, I can't wrote to me and said they found my to cover panels that we're still missing and told me I had to buy a gift card and use that gift card to purchase them and just write them back with the information after I made the purchase. I spent another $129 in an effort to finish my project but my information went into the ether and I never heard back from anyone. I called to get refunded it was promised I would but never received a refund for that eiher.

When I called to ask them to at least come pick up the stuff they delivered that was NOT REQUESTED they asked that I pay $89 for the pick up process. I am at a loss. I have not received one dime in a refund. I have huge packages that won't fit in my car and no recourse whatsoever. PLEASE LEARN FROM MY EXPERIENCE. They are great at the outset but anything that requires customer service will result in hours of hold times, promises that never come to fruition and endless case and order numbers you're suppose to keep track of just to be told theyll call for the refund and never hear a thing. It might seem like the budget option but it is not. I'm so frustrated and upset and THERE IS NOTHING I CAN DO. BEWARE!!",Trustpilot_USA

If you're considering purchasing a kitchen from IKEA Amsterdam, I strongly advise you to double-check whether all necessary components are in stock. The ongoing stock issues have caused significant delays and headaches for me. The lack of any proactive communication from IKEA only exacerbates the problem.

1. Customer Service: An improvement in communication is urgently needed.

2. Stock Management: Ensure that stock levels match what's promised to customers.

"Worst customer support . Worst customer support and process ever. They’ve done a series of blunders over last week with a simple replacement item. It has taken me around 5 calls and I’ve yet to receive the item.
If I am not compensated for the stress, misery and waste of my time this is a case for the Ombudsman. I am hoping someone responsible will listen to the call recordings for all my phone calls to understand the shambles their customer services is in.
A week ago I called in to get a replacement for an item that is under warranty. The agent agreed it was under warranty and transferred me to another agent who said I’ll have to come and collect as the item was not available for delivery. I challenged why should I be required to collect (by the way, I could see the item online available for delivery from nearest store). When I challenged the line dropped (or he hung up??). Nobody called me back so called again after a couple of hours and this time someone was able to book a delivery for last Friday saying I will receive text message with a 4hr slot closer to time. I also asked to change delivery address as we’ve moved!!
Come Friday and I had not received a text or anything, so I called again and asked where my order was, to be told that the previous agent had made a mistake in placing the order and this time they’d get it right. Then the agent tells me that I need to call again on Monday as the item was going to come in stock (all this time I can see the item is available online). When I said why do I need to call and why can’t they place an order for me based on this and the last call, she said ‘that’s the process’. When I said I want to put in a complaint the agent laughed and said she was from the complaints department and ‘the complaint won’t go anywhere’ (horrendous and unacceptable customer service).
I hung up and called again and repeated my whole dilemma to a new agent who on a very long call tells me that the item is discontinued and everything I’ve been told so far was a lie. He then tells me he can send an alternative item that will fit, but I will have to pay for the difference. I challenged that as well and after a few long holds he confirmed they’d do a like for like replacement with out any charges. The item was booked for today, and I got text messages yesterday and today that the item will be delivered in a 4hr slot.
When the driver called me closer to arrival I’ve realised he was on his way to the old address.
Now I have a fitter coming in tomorrow for another work and the item will not arrive on time. When I mentioned this to customer service on the call today all they could offer me was £20 and increased to £30 after a 5min hold.
This is absolutely unacceptable customer service from IKEA. I do not need a goodwill compensation but expect them to pay for the fitting which I’ll have to arrange separately.

"Wrong cabinet for a kitchen and no refund?! . I have worked with Ikea Lichtenberg in Berlin on my kitchen planning (which is a very expensive purchase as everyone knows) and on the day of the building it was found out that they had sent a white cabinet for a fully black kitchen. I was told on the day of the building that I either had to wait an indefinite amount of time for the black cabinet to be delivered, leaving me in a ridiculous situation without a fully built kitchen or I could keep the white one and ask for a 15% refund on the whole kitchen order to Ikea. Since the cabinet was inside anyways, I decided to accept and ask for the refund.

On the phone I was told that I couldn't receive any refund because in the original order (made by the kitchen planner, not by me) there were 4 door joints missing that Ikea did not make me pay for. Since I had not noticed those small parts were missing in a FULL KITCHEN ORDER, I was blamed. The cabinet and the joints sort of had the same price, so in their eyes the fact that I was given a white cabinet instead of a black one for a 4000 euros kitchen apparently had no importance.

They might do in price, but 4 door joints and a CABINET do not have the same value. It is not the same thing. Not to mention that I was told a straight out lie about the 15% discount that also contributed to my decision to keep the white cabinet in the first place. On the phone I was treated like an hysteric by the Ikea Lichtenberg customer service for trying to point it out.

IKEA advertises itself as being able to furnish homes and so an order of the size that I placed should not be out of the ordinary. I have not had issues with other companies eg Amazon and so it highlights the system failures clearly evident at IKEA. I have just moved to the US and I was so excited about my move; I have had a wonderful transition with my employers; I found a superb apartment in a beautiful area - everyone I have interacted with have been so welcoming and friendly. Yet the extremely poor experience I have had with IKEA these past three weeks has diminished all the positives - IKEA have so nearly ruined my move to the US and tarnished what should have been an smooth, stress-free transition.",Trustpilot_USA

I was away so had my brother on stand by to leave the driver in to drop the goods at my house.

On August 14, I bought a bed from Ikea.
Paid all three steps: buying a bed,
delivery,
assembly.
.2 days later, on Thursday, I was supposed to have a bed delivered between 4:00 and 6:00 PM.
I canceled all my business and stayed at home. I dismantled my last bed and carried it outside.
.an hour and a half before delivery, I received an SMS that the person who was supposed to assemble the bed had injured his back and would not be able to come, and if I want to, I can cancel and find my loader. .I don't have time to look for someone who assembles furniture. That's why I paid for the assembly.
I do not understand why this is my problem if I paid for the service while in IKEA?
.I spent 3 hours of my time on the phone with Ikea representatives. They sent me to a moving company. And the moving company back to Ikea.
And so it was four times. I was given different phone numbers and waited on hold there for a long time.
.and again told everyone about this problem.
And how many nerves I spent for a spoiled mood and a day is very difficult to tell. Well my son slept on the floor. I don't know who to say Thank you for such a ""Service"".

"Crooks liars and thieves, stay clear of this company . I placed an order for a clock, a filing cabinet and some other small items. Based on my past experience with their sloppy shipping practices, the heavy filing cabinet was thrown together as expected in a large box with the clock and other items banging around on its way to my destination. I received a broken clock, defective looking filing cabinet parts, bent metal with cracking and paint peeling everywhere. I called The customer abuse line and this time the rep was very pleasant in her conversation with me and promised to replace the broken clock and refund me for the filing cabinet. I requested the refund in the form of store credit so I could put it towards another purchase with the company. I also asked if I needed to pack the unit back up for them to retrieve it since I had started assembling it and paused the process once I realize there were some defective parts. I was instructed to take photos of the defects and provide them via email so an assessment could be done to see if the item needed to be sent back or disposed of. After supplying the photos via email there was no confirmation email of a return being accepted, photos received...NOTHING. 3 weeks passed and I called them to inquire about my refund and was told that a refund was issued 5 days or so prior to me calling so I thanked the rep and went on my merry way.
3 more weeks passed and still no gift card arrived via email I called them once again and this time a rep told me a refund was issued but it was back to my original form of payment. I told him there was no refund received on my end and asked them for this information in writing and to provide some kind of confirmation and this is where things got really weird. The rep claimed this was impossible because the case was closed. He insisted he could provide no proof then put me on hold for almost a half and hr only to come back and tell me he had nothing. I asked to speak to a supervisor he said his supervisor insisted that he should refuse to transfer me to anyone higher up. I insisted on speaking to a manager and he once again put me on hold for about ten minutes then came back saying that he went ahead and canceled the original refund and issued another one but still could provide nothing in writing about the specifics of the refund. At this point I told him that I am going to hang up and call back to speak to someone else because I felt like I was getting the run around and simply pure dishonesty. I attempted to call back and all I got was a message saying ""You're call cannot be completed at this time"" .
So to sum it all up this crooked company shipped me a defective item, lied to me about refunding my money and after I called in to get down to the bottom of it I was continually lied to then they blocked my number from calling their 1888 customer abuse line while still holding my refund hostage.

"Ikea's terrible customer service and delivery service . I was left thoroughly disappointed by my recent encounter with Ikea's delivery service. Despite shelling out a significant fee for delivery, the delivery team adamantly refused to transport heavy items upstairs. Regrettably, Ikea's customer service proved inadequate in addressing this concern, casting doubt upon the brand's dedication to customer contentment and accountability. This distressing incident has significantly marred my perception of Ikea. The premium I paid for delivery proved futile, leaving me exasperated and prompting a reevaluation of my future interactions with the company.

Also, my endeavor to engage in Ikea's touted furniture reselling initiative took an unforeseen detour. Upon arrival at the store with my furniture in tow, I was informed that reassembly was mandatory for eligibility, a stipulation not sufficiently emphasized on their website. While the notion of ecologically sound furniture resale is laudable, the unexpected demand for reassembly injected an unwelcome degree of inconvenience into the process. This served to diminish the overall experience, highlighting a dissonance between the promoted ease and the practical realities of the procedure.",Trustpilot_USA

"An absolute nightmare to deal with. . An absolute nightmare to deal with.

My husband and I had been shopping around for sets of bookshelves, and found the perfect modular set on the IKEA website. Since the nearest IKEA is 2 hours away, our first plan (back when we were younger and naive and assumed IKEA functioned like any respectable box store) was to order the items to this store and make a day of it - drive in, peruse the store to see if there was anything else we wanted, eat meatballs for lunch, pick up our order, drive home. Sounded lovely.

EXCEPT. IKEA doesn't ship to its own stores? If you want to pick-up, it has to be from some random 'pick-up location' - like, say, a parking lot - which you STILL get charged to use? Well fine, we thought, we can still make a day of it. Went to place the order online, but OH WAIT! some of the items in the order are listed as ""not available for pick-up."" Well, I don't need HALF a set of anything, that would be stupid and pointless. The name of my shelves isn't HALFENSHELV, is it?

WELL fine, we thought again, what about delivery, then? Ah, look! All items are available! Wonderful! Placed the order, picked one of the delivery dates THEY offered, recieved confirmation, and it's off the bookcase races we go!

(I'll spare you the extra rant here about the TWELVE HOUR delivery window, and the $150 delivery fee, because we don't have all day.)(Though IKEA seems to think differently.)

The day of delivery, I am emailed the tracking information for my order - oooh, fancy! I can watch my shelves trundle around Ontario in real time! Stop 1, stop 2, stop 3... Go shelves, go! EXCEPT... huh. Weird. Why are there 2 tracking numbers? Ok... they've split my order in half? Three pieces with one tracking number, one piece with the other tracking number. So while truck #1 is dutifully dropping orders left and right like the little engine that could, number #2 isn't moving at all. In fact, it's still listed as 'being packaged for delivery.'

So I call IKEA for what I thought was simple query, and unbeknowst to me, embarked on the Worst Customer Service Experience of All Time.

After an hour and fifteen minutes on the phone, I am told, 'that item isn't coming because it's on backorder.'

But, I insist, the website clearly said it was available!

'That happens all the time,' they explain, as if this is a perfectly reasonable justification. Which, for the official record, it is NOT. 'When it comes in we'll ship it.'

'No, I travel frequently, and will not be home for the next 3 weeks - let's schedule it for the Saturday I get back, then.'

'We can't schedule anything that far in advance.' (FFS, REALLY?) 'We'll put a hold on the order and you can call to book that day when you get back.'

WELL FINE. LET'S FRICKEN DO THAT, THEN.

Fast forward 3 weeks - back home, rested and rejuvenated and ready to finish the HALFENSHELV that's been partially assembled in my livingroom since last month.

I hold my breath, pinch my nose and call IKEA customer service, on Monday morning. The following is a brief synopsis:

Nope, can't deliver to you Saturday. Care to book a day off work, cause we can do next Monday! No? Next Saturday? Oh, at a wedding, ok. Thursday? Oh, right, that pesky job again. Ok is there a date you'd like? Ah, sorry, no, WE CAN'T BOOK THAT FAR IN ADVANCE. Ok, well, you can always cancel the order and try again later.

TRY AGAIN? I'M SORRY, WHEN DID THIS BECOME A CARNIVAL GAME? SHOULD I CHECK WHICH PLANET IS IN RETROGRADE BEFORE ORDERING NEXT TIME?

Seriously, though. What the hell, ikea. What the honest, ever-loving hell.

Oh, and in the midst of all that, they hung up on me. But I called back, purely out of spite at this point, and am now at hour #3, with rep #4.

So now I'm taking a day off work, to (HOPEFULLY) be done with this horseshit once and for all.

And, of course, IKEA offered nothing to compensate for any of this. (Oh, sorry - they graciously offered to waive the second delivery fee. You know, the SECOND $150 they were going to charge me for stupidly expecting that the one order I ordered, as one order, would be delivered as one order? Yes, they waived that. How benevolent!)

In the end, however, I WAS offered an extra $150 gift card (we'll see if it ever arrives! Knock down all five milk bottles, win a refund!), only after I made this offer to customer service rep #4:

""Give me a refund, OR... just say these exact words back to me: 'IKEA doesn't care about you, or any of our customers. We lied, and we didn't deliver, because you, and your time, don't matter to us.' Say this to me, and I'll hang up satisfied.""

I highly recommend everyone try this, because hearing them stutter and stammer out off-script excuses about how saying that would be 'disrepectful' to you (unlike the rest of the experience, of course), is the closest you'll ever come to feeling satisfied by an IKEA delivery.",Trustpilot_USA

"Terrible delivery and installation service . Terrible, terrible after sales/delivery/installation service.

We bought kitchen appliances from IKEA Goya on 20 July. We had no choice as we purchased a home with newly built IKEA kitchen furniture that was designed for the size of IKEA appliances. After much consultation, we were assured of the compatibility of the appliances to the furniture, and the scheduled delivery and installation on 26 July. When the delivery and installation personnel came, they told us the cabinets needed some modification that they cannot do. This came as a surprise to us but we could not do anything. They left the appliances with us, uninstalled.

We had to go to IKEA Goya personally to settle the matter but customer service could not help us. Instead, they lectured us on their reporting protocols (can only act on a delivery report within 24 hours), instances of liability and their inability to do minor adjustments to the kitchen cabinets simply because we do not have a receipt in our name! We offered to pay for the modification service but they said it cannot be done. Since the agent who attended to us during our purchase was not reporting for work that day, all that customer service could offer was for us to schedule a meeting with him the following day and book a new installation date on 28 July!

Frustrated, we had an independent carpentry crew do the minor modifications to the furniture (remove brackets to allow space for appliances to be introduced) to ensure that installation can proceed on 28 July. We also went to the store again to meet with the agent to ensure that the installation will be on schedule. We were assured of such.

Come 28 July, from 9am to 9pm, we waited (and cancelled other schedules for this), but no one came. We called at 4pm to make sure that the schedule was confirmed and were told that it was on the crew's work list and that they may be on their way. At 9pm, another call to customer service and it was confirmed that they are unable to make it. We were even asked, did anyone call you? (And by the way, we were always asked our phone number and told that we will receive a call--no call came.) We were ""offered"" the next available schedule of Monday, the day that we clearly informed IKEA we will already be leaving. And what were we told? That's all that they can do.

Now we are in a bind because this only gives us one option--rebook very expensive flights to wait for IKEA. Pathetic.",Trustpilot_USA

"Poor customer service at IKEA Melbourne . I am writing with great frustration with IKEA customer service. I have purchase online some furnitures and expecting them to deliver on 17th July. This has been planned by booking the slot with our building management to allow delivery on 17th July afternoon (1 TO 4PM). And the installer is supposed to come the next day. With these, we had to sleep on the floor in sleeping bags for 2 nights. Notes have been given on the order about the delivery time slot however on that day, the logistic partner - Kings Transport & Logistic company didn't contact us despite new number has been updated to IKEA.
When we reached 4pm, someone from IKEA (Jason) called us to inform us that the driver would be lated. Eventually the driver called us around 4:30am and they asked about the location of the loading bay as well as its height. They claimed that the address given wasn't complete but we have provided full information on our order. My daughter went downstairs to ensure delivery was possible since they were late. Building manager asked them to wait 5-10 mins since there was a truck unloading. He commented that they were late. Then to our surprise, the delivery guy commented that they could cancel the order and not deliver. Very very petty and rude to us but push the blame to the building manager. It was such an unbelievable experience and I think that guy was crazy. How could IKEA partner with a logistic company which has such a poor attitude? The delivery guy with a wrap over his head (don't know his name) was complaining and complaining. He acted like a king and refused to deliver our furniture. We left with no furniture and the appointment with the installer was forced to cancel. Then the delivery was rearranged on Tues, same thing happened that they had cancelled on our order. They claimed that they had waited for 45 mins and there's no space for unloading. Again, it was not true.

The delivery company has BIG issues with the people they had hired. During the 3rd attempt, the team has shared with me that those 2 orders were delivered by subbies, not full time staff. I am truly disappointed with IKEA as I am the customer to IKEA and not the logistic company. Yet, they had not take responsibility to resolve the problem caused by their logistic partner. In the end, IKEA has refunded the delivery fee and I had to cancelled the assembly because of the long wait and again IKEA wasn't helping me out. We had literally slept on the floor for the whole week. This incident has given me a very bad impression on IKEA and their logistic service provider. I hope the IKEA management could look into this matter else I have no confidence to patronise IKEA anymore. Bear in mind, I am a regular customer of IKEA in other part of the world and I had never come across such bad service. It is such a BIG disappointment.",Trustpilot_USA

Please be warned ikea may offer a year warranty but when there aware of this malm product yellowing unless it’s a safety issue they won’t recall or offer any good will gesture for there own malfunctioning product when there well aware of this happening
If you have any white malm products I’d check the edges for consistent yellowing and if you do have your receipt still under a year take it back and get a new one every 12 months before your warranty runs out until ikea does something about there product or products that only last a year!🤬",Trustpilot_USA

Either way, a day after the failed collection it hadn't been cancelled yet so spoke with customer service (Nathan) again who this time said the order is held for 2 days and that it wouldn't be cancelled until then.

"Unbelievably bad experience . I had an unbelievably bad experience with IKEA. I made an order a couple of weeks ago for a total value of roughly $3'000, and paid the additional fee for the In-home delivery scheduling June 30th as delivery date. The reason why I selected June 30th is that I'm currently in Italy and will be landing in NY on that day, so I can't be home to accept deliveries any day before that and my building is not able to accept deliveries on my behalf.
Unfortunately, though, two days ago I got an email from IKEA saying that I would receive part of the order on June 28th and part on July 3rd. I thus immediately called customer service (despite currently being in Italy and having to pay extra for overseas calls), and was told that the part scheduled for July 3rd was brought back to June 30th as I had requested, and the part scheduled for June 28th was managed by FedEx and could be changed only after I got an email from FedEx, and that I would have had to call again IKEA after I got this FedEx email. So, yesterday I called IKEA again, right after receiving the FedEx email, and was assured that they had informed FedEx that the package should be delivered June 30th. Today I woke up to another FedEx email that confirms that the package is on its way and confirmed to be delivered today, June 28th.
Now, I honestly don't know who's to blame here, but what I'm getting from IKEA is an enormous sense of incompetence and lack of care.

We had to pick up kids from school in Co Wexford at 2:30, so couldn't wait around in Carrickmines.

We had driven up in 2 cars from Gorey (an hour and a half wasted each way, for 2 people, €26 diesel and €29 in petrol) but were told by the online chat complaints team that no further compensation would be offered. I'd compare it to booking a table for lunch at 12, with the food prepaid, then turning up and being told ""sorry, we don't have your food or table ready for you, you can wait 3 hours, or we'll send you free takeout in 3 days' time instead"". Who in their right mind thinks this is decent customer service? The chat team also told me I ""should wait to be told when the order is ready for collection"", which is all well and good when you're living a 10-minute drive away, but not 2 counties and 1.5hrs away! My email confirmation clearly stated a 12 noon pickup when I paid for my items. The ""4-hour window"" they referenced seems to mean (to them!) that they can bring it to the pickup point anytime within those 4 hours, when any rational customer would understand a 4-hr window to mean that the purchases would be there at 12 noon and the customer would have 4 hours to collect them. Shocking service, shocking lack of compensation, shocking lack of acceptance of responsibility.

I asked never ever to be served by them ever again, just to get the delivery done by that nasty company and only to get informed that the delivery would be delayed by 3 days on a Saturday. This is the very last time I would ever, ever order from IKEA again, despite being Swedish. I’d rather have quality goods, service and delivery than this utterly deplorable service. I hope that you will learn a lesson from their poor performance and consider other alternatives. Au revoir IKEA a plus jamais!",Trustpilot_USA
"Dreadful experience . I am really frustrated at the service I am getting! I ordered a kitchen island 45 days ago! After 1 month, I had the wrong work top delivered to me. I booked someone to install the kitchen island for me on the day of the delivery, but given the wrong worktop, I had to pay him £300 for doing nothing! It has been 15 days since and after calling them several times and even visiting the store in person, they cannot give me a new date for delivery of the correct worktop!
I wonder how they were able to place my initial order in a couple of minutes to take my money, but now that they messed up, they cannot fix it! In my house, I have a kitchen island with no work top and no one knows when I will receive the work top I paid for more 45 days ago!! Really frustrating.",Trustpilot_USA

The first person I was connected to was incredibly slow at responding and then transferred me to someone else because they couldn't deal with the issue. The second person I spoke to then informed me a refund couldn't be issued because I had apparently 'misused' the items and said that nothing could be done. I asked them why I wasn't informed of this sooner and they ignored the question until I pressed them on it and they eventually told me I was notified about this when I contacted them about a refund a month ago, which never happened. When I told them I had never contacted them before this, he angrily replied that I had just mentioned in this chat that I contacted them a month ago about a refund, but I pointed out that I never said this and in fact said I returned the items a month ago. They finally looked into the issue properly and issued a refund.

At the same time, IKEA asked me to complain to the inspection company if I wish further complaints.

"This is not a complaint . This is not a complaint, but a review. I wanted to buy some kitchen utensils. I entered IKEA in Riga, Latvia. I was there for the first time. The first astonishment was the unnecessarily complicated configuration and entry-exit of the parking lot, where the designers are confused in their craftsmanship. Okay, I went into the store to look for the product I needed. An unpleasant surprise was that, in order to find the item, I was driven zigzag along some unnecessary long route like a ram. With a sore leg, I wandered a long way, but then I realized that I felt like I was in the Minotaur's labyrinth (ancient Greek mythology) and I didn't want to stay in this ram's lair, but there was no way out. The placement of the product is not transparent, and the sales concept is chasing the buyer along a certain trajectory in the hope that he will buy something - on the basis of impulsive action. I find such a concept humiliating. It should be noted that I didn't buy anything because I wanted to get out of this maze as soon as possible, and also with a firm commitment never to shop at IKEA under any circumstances, because I don't want to feel like a ram in a trap, driven where the seller wants, not where the buyer needs. I was at IKEA twice at the same time - the first and also the last. I went to the supermarket, where everything is transparent and easy to buy. I was informed that IKEA is a store for young people who are starting to arrange their lives, but the concept of au laidar surprised me very unpleasantly - it is a humiliation.

"Cheap furniture with ZERO after sales help. . I used to love IKEA but I've had nothing but issues with them recently. I bought a Kitchen which arrived damaged in some parts and had to be returned. For whatever reason, they thought it was a good idea to permanently print the door serial number and product name directly on the inside of each kitchen door so, I have to look at this single every day. Whoever thought this was a good idea should have a word with themselves. The assembly instructions are infuriating to navigate. I'm a designer and I spent most of my time correcting how they should have communicated steps in my head. Besides all of this; there is ZERO after sales care to speak of. If you ask to speak with someone in Dublin directly - you're told no. If you call the English phone number for IKEA to ask a question; they don't have a clue what you're talking about. I finally got through to a manager from the Kitchen dept in Dublin and, besides generally speaking over me; she said that they're too busy to deal with after sales on an individual basis. IKEA make more than enough money to change this.

Their Buyback and Resell programme is an absolute scam. I went to the Dublin branch on Saturday with over €1000 worth of BESTA furniture. The furniture has been through two house moves so, it had light scratching throughout. I did an online estimate through the IKEA website and should have received about €400 for everything. I had to arrange for a van to transport everything to the branch, only to be told that they wouldn't give me anything for any of it, because the units had screw holes in the sides. THIS IT LITERALLY HOW THE PIECES ASSEMBLE TO ONE ANOTHER. This is how the instructions state they be assembled. If resold altogether; no holes would be visible once assembled???? If this is actually the case, IKEA should not accept any BESTA combinations back, as this is how all BESTA furniture is assembled. At the very least, they could mention that items with screw holes cannot be accepted online, so customers like me don't waste their time going to trouble bringing furniture back. I had to leave €1000 worth of BESTA furniture behind to be 'recycled'. I do not believe for a second that this will actually happen. They gave me a pitiful 'waver' to sign which at no point stated that they will not sell the items I left to be 'recycled'. I have no doubt that they will sell these items on, without compensating me for it.

I bought another unit while in the store on Saturday and brought it home. Not only have the prices gone up but the quality of the materials have also gone down. We put the base of the unit together and it felt so flimsy to handle. Like the slightest knock would cause serious damage. There are also a couple of flaws throughout that just shouldn't be there. I am dreading putting the doors on and if there's a single scratch on anything else, it will be going straight back.",Trustpilot_USA

"Ikea Assembling - The Worst Experience Ever . Last April, I spent thousands of euros buying IKEA Items and expended extra money to assemble them by IKEA Team, thinking this would be the safest choice to avoid problems.

The experience was completely the opposite.

One of the assemblers was very good and polite, but the other was not professional at all. Beyond the fact that this assembler stepped in dog feces and walked all around the house, and didn't clean the floor (even after him what he had done), my neighbours asked why they were not invited to the Open House party (???) because they thought that the loud music during assembling was a party.

Finally, they were oriented by their manager, who refused to assemble the BESTA TV Frame, informing them that it didn't have rails. To understand that, considering the project was made by the group team in the store, I went back to IKEA Delft in person to talk with the IKEA BESTA department, and they guaranteed me that the BESTA TV already had in the Kit four Ls to support for the hanging. The information was also in the BESTA TV Document!

The customer service who attended to my complaint on the first floor confirmed the information.

After six days, the department responsible for replying to the complaint in the store sent me an e-mail, asking how I cleared the dog feces, and I informed that I handle with it own myself.

Beyond that and the worst part, apparently the team who answered the complaint probably consulted only the assembling company and said that it is not possible to hang the frame on the wall, but let's go deeper into this:

1) The BESTA TV Frame DOCUMENTS show how you should hang it on the wall
2) The BESTA Department in Delft Store CONFIRMED that it is possible to hang it on the walls because the BESTA TV Frame already have the items necessary for it in the Kit
3) Two areas of the IKEA Delft Store CONFIRMED that the item could be hang

To finalize the e-mail they just sent the problem to me and said I should hire an assembler to do the work I had already paid for.

After a week, because a new order for other assembling, even after postpone the new assembling they the finally decided to read the manual and hang the BESTA TV. Althoght, they blocked the energy socket, so I requested then to open hole in the back so I could reach the socket, but they informed that they couldn't do it and I should hire a handyman to open a hole in the back part of it, or I should do it by myself.

After cutting myself trying t do it and after spent more than 7 thousand euros in the store for items and assembly, the minimum that I expected was RESPECT.

So, let me summarize:
1) Show minimum respect for your consumers
2) Prepare and train your partners and customer service employees to be at least well-informed about your products
3) You can hire teams that can spread feces in my house, but don’t put the hot potato in your customers hands otherwise no one will respect Ikea as a brand that they can trust on.",Trustpilot_USA

"Discrimination at Ikea Halifax . I am writing to express my deep disappointment and frustration with the unacceptable behavior of one of your customer service representatives at the Ikea Halifax store. I visited the store today morning at 10:40 am to return an item with the original receipt and the item in its original package. I had my credit card, which I used when I first purchased the item.

However, the customer service representative, Cindy, who was conducting the transaction, treated me and my wife with discrimination because my wife was wearing a hijab veil. Cindy started the conversation by accusing me of returning the item before, even though I had the original receipt and the item number on the original package matched that on the receipt. When I explained that I had done a different return two days ago and showed her the return receipt, she asked to check my credit card physically, which was suspicious to me. This was the first time that a representative had wanted to hold my card to check it.

When I asked Cindy what was wrong with the return and even suggested that she could still process the return even if my card had a different number, she became more aggressive and called me rude. She refused to proceed with the transaction and left the counter, leaving myself and my wife stranded.

When I went to look for a manager on the floor, I could not find one. Eventually, someone named Conor showed up and introduced himself as the manager. However, when I asked to meet with the store manager or deputy, Conor told me that both were unavailable and refused to arrange a meeting.

When I went back to the counter, I found that Cindy had returned and thrown the item back in my wife's face and refused to serve us, calling me rude again. Her coworkers, Valiyn and Courtney, and even Conor, refused to give us her name. When I insisted on speaking with a manager, Conor finally gave me her first name only after speaking with the Deputy Store Manager, Geraldine, who also refused to meet with us.

I am deeply disappointed with the behavior of your employees, who not only discriminated against my wife but also insulted and disrespected me as a customer. I was appalled by the lack of management on the floor, the absence of titles on name tags, and the fact that your employees introduce themselves as managers when they are not. This behavior is completely unacceptable, and it is unacceptable for a customer to leave with their dignity on the floor.

I demand an immediate and thorough investigation of this incident, including disciplinary action against Cindy and any other employees involved in this unacceptable behavior. I also demand a formal apology and compensation for the humiliation and distress caused to myself and my wife.

I have received a complaint reference number (Ref# 2798284), which I have no idea what was written in it. I expect the after-sales manager to contact me promptly to discuss this matter and to take appropriate action.

I hope that you will take this matter seriously and take the necessary steps to ensure that this type of behavior does not occur again in the future.",Trustpilot_USA

"Don’t waste your time . Ordered a small item on-line, just £15 plus £4 delivery.
A complete an utter waste of time.
Apparently ‘out for delivery’ three days later….so far so good.
Tracked the order which remained ‘out for delivery’ from 17th to 30th April with DPD. Then somewhat miraculously the order was backdated to ‘Delivered’ on 25th April. Of course no delivery took place and I’ve no idea where the package is now.
Just try contacting IKEA and if you’re lucky enough to find a number and actually speak to a human you’ll be disappointed.
You’ll be put on hold and hear nothing more from the agent and will be cut off after 30 or so minutes.

"Should have been 5 stars BUT : . Read the reviews concerning delivery so decided to opt for the CLICK & COLLECT service (bristol ikea ) have to say it was seamless. Gave the confirmation email etc and goods were brought out on a trolley, so off we went to our car saying ""gosh that was easy "" to then be stopped by a man in a high viz jacket saying you cannot leave the store with that yellow bag ! So as we looked at our trolley yes indeed part of our order had been put in the said yellow bag. So I asked "" why put them in this bag if you cannot leave the store with them ""...he didn't reply. So we emptied the bits and gave him the bag, before we could take one step he stopped us again ""where was our receipt for the goods ? So got it out he looked at it and said ok.

"damaged items not replaced . We are from Louisiana. We don't have an IKEA warehouse here. We've been looking for a bed for our teenager and we liked FLEKKE with IKEA. Since we were planning our vacation in Florida, it was decided to go to the local IKEA at Jacksonville and purchase the bed. So we did. On arriving back home in Louisiana we found out that the box was damaged by a forklift together with the items inside (and the damages were masked/concealed from the outside, so it was impossible to see them in store). We called to replace two items - one was sent to us. Called again - another was sent. All this takes time, and we needed the bed to sleep on. On receiving the second replacement item we started to put together the bed. Unfortunately, we found out that one more part is also damaged. The Jacksonville store refused to supply us with the last damaged item, suggesting to bring the bed back (550 miles trip).

"Sawdust & Glue !!! . My daughter made the huge mistake of buying a Malm 6 Drawer “Particle Board” Dresser from IKEA.

Big Mistake !!!!

It’s amazing how this company has the nerve to charge over $400 for a dresser that’s made of 150% sawdust & glue that is pressed together.

All my daughter did was simply close a drawer and a “particle cross board” snaps on her.

When you assemble junk like this, make sure that your are satisfied where you put it because if you dare move it in the future, it will easily come apart and snap on you. Your beverage rings will also be well noticed too…..so lay a towel down 1st. (thats what sawdust will do.)

I even went to IKEA’s website to get replacement parts. Their website is useless. You cannot order replacement particle boards.

When the day finally comes to launch this junk out on your lawn, be sure to cover it up. If it gets wet, it will swell and become 50 times heavier and your garbage men will be mad at you.

What happened to the good old days when furniture was made of this thing called “real wood”?

If you are looking for a furniture sawdust & glue mill….IKEA is the perfect place to go !!!

"Ikea Egypt is a very bad experience . Ikea Egypt is a very bad experience! I have ordered a book shelf from Ikea.eg, I have paid almost 17000 LE. I have scheduled the delivery for Thursday, but someone called me and said we can delivered two days earlier. I said no as nobody was at home. On Thursday (the planned delivery day), we have waited until 16:00 clock and no delivery, until we contacted IKEA via the chat option on IKEA.eg and informed the central delivery station. An unidentified car park in front of my home and three persons wearing normal cloths (Usually, they come with IKEA official wearing) bought and assembled the box. They have tried several time and failed. Again contacted IKEA chat, nothing happen. We refused to accept the box and did not sign the delivery notice (this was a wise decission). After several complaints, I have finally received a phone call with the customer service, who was convincing me to take the cabinet as it is with the defect (what a shame!). He also informed me that IKEA has an agreement with a subcontractor, who did this mistake. I told him it is none of my business, I ordered the stuff from IKEA, not a subcontractor. Thanks for the online Egyptian law, I told him come take your stuff as per online purchase law. Finally, they came and pick up the cabinet. Now started the session two of the story, when I bought the cabinet, they have charged my master card on the same moment. When it comes to refund, I never heard from them so far, It is almost one week. I send several Email and contacted IKEA via the chat option, every time, we will contact you within 48 hours, within one day and almost a week and nothing. No confirmation of a refund.

The pick up service couldn't figure out how an interphone worked so decided to leave. I am not spending a 3rd day waiting like an idiot for this, IKEA should stop promising services it clearly cannot offer or maybe fire the geniuses it has hired for deliveries (who don't know how to ring a doorbell or use a phone). Customer service on the phone today was ""very sorry"" but couldn't offer any compensation for the trouble or any solution other than waiting again for this magical pickup service to maybe show up on another day.

Then, suddenly the item was available in Milton Keynes. I've confirmed and told them please send it to me immediately. Then, he asked me again when I should receive it. I've told him if you work on 7th April, please deliver it by 11am. He took 5-10 mins again to book it for me, but he told me that he can't see delivery slot! How come, it wasn't available again after 5 mins and Deepak told me that 'we'll refund missing items'. So? I have one part of the sofa, and the other part is missing. What's the point? Do I put this sofa to my living room as a half?? After 2 hrs discussion, I have nothing. I've offered IKEA to refund full, and deliver it to me asap, then if they send the missing part, they should charge me again. However, they didn't accept it. Deepak opened the case for me. Then, we finished the conversation after 2 hrs! Later on, I've checked IKEA website again and they still sell the same sofa which costs £764 for their customer. I have a video as a proof.

On the day of scheduled delivery, not all items were delivered. I was on the phone with the hotline for 2 hrs. They said it's my problem and I would have to call the delivery company. The delivery company told me they could not pickup the items at the local IKEA store. I called the hotline again and they could not help me. They offered to either refund the missing items or they could reorder them and they would be arriving earliest one week later. However one item was not available and they could not tell me if it would be available again at all. They also said that I would have to pay for the delivery again. Even though it was not my fault that IKEA messed up the delivery. I was on the phone for another hour since I could not believe what I was offered.

Problem 3:
The next day I decided to go to the local store. They understood my complaint and since the one item that could not be delivered was not going to be restocked I chose a different item in the store. The item was oversold which was the reason that the delivery that included this item could not be delivered. The reason I went to the store was that the missing items included bed and sofa so I had nothing to sleep on. The IKEA employees in the store were helpful and processed my purchase and told me to get a same day delivery with lugg which would of course be reimbursed. I purchased the same day delivery in the store and the employee took all the information for generating my refund.
After two weeks I still did not get a refund so I had to call the hotline again. They told me I would not get a refund. After another 20 minutes they stated the reason, that there would be a wrong amount on the lugg receipt. I should go to the store to clarify that.

"I left a one star review on IKEA's… . I left a one star review on IKEA's website for their LURÖY slatted bed base. Reviews apparently have to be reviewed by them first before posting to the website. They never approved it, probably because it was one star. I know because I left a review on another product the same day, this time three stars, and they let that one post. So I'll just give the review here:

The LURÖY slatted bed base has a very poor design because these slats (that are incredibly flimsy) just lay on the bedframe and center piece once it's put together. They don't latch into place or anything, so it's very easy for them to move around, especially after your mattress is sat on them. They fell off the frame and onto the floor underneath my bed not a week into owning the bed. Useless! I had to drill some holes through the slats and into the bedframe to hold them in place with screws. Do not recommend.",Trustpilot_USA

Sure buy from IKEA if you want to replace your furniture in a year or two. I’d much rather buy from a U.S. based manufacturer with far superior quality furniture. I know my furniture will last 20 times longer than anything you buy from IKEA.

"Very negative impression about IKEA service and customer support. My money was stolen . I ordered 4 wardrobes in IKEA shop with delivery to my apartment (3rd floor of the building). IKEA hotline confirmed that the order will be delivered to my 3rd floor.
Unfortunately, when IKEA delivery track arrived IKEA delivery staff said that they are very busy and they left everything on the ground floor. And there was rainy on this day.
I am old and am not able to bring all these heavy boxes into my apartment on the 3rd floor.
So I paid 130 euros to one of my neighbors to deliver all these boxes to my third floor. And he spent half of the day doing this. There was no other way to solve this problem created by IKEA staff.
Last month I sent already 3 e-mails to the customer support of IKEA with a request to return my money back to my bank account (because I paid for the delivery of these wardrobes to my apartment) and as a result, there are only their automatic answers ""We have received your email and will respond to your query within 24 hours"" and nothing more :-). They never replied to me. So my money was just stolen by IKEA.
I was an IKEA client for many years and now I am very dissatisfied with the low level of service and customer support presented by IKEA. And, of course, stealing the money of clients is absolutely terrible story for the reputation of the company.",Trustpilot_USA

I told them twice by email that I was on disability (back problem) and could not drive and go into a store. I have had no response from them. This is shameful on two counts: not taking responsibility for mistakes and responsibilities. Not caring about the difficulties of people with disabilities.

"Ikea, killing the environment . I'm am utterly astonished at the incompetence of the process Ikea have put me through to buy a wardrobe flat pack!

I checked stock on line.
I called IKEA
I drove to my nearest store (Reading) 23 miles away.
I spoke to information point at the wardrobe area and my order was taken.
A sheet with location and items needed to pick up was printed off.
Went to location and it was empty.
Had to drive home, another 23 miles.
Went on line and ordered to collect from nearest collection point, Kingston. 31 miles from my home.
Collected as instructed, 62 mile round trip.
Got home to find NO hinges with order, which were on paper work.
Contact customer service and have to order the hinges to arrive Saturday!
So another journey for your product.
I get offered £30 evocher, to be spent in your store, another 46 mile round trip.
But hey at least I could pick up hinges have some food and get wardrobe doors on before missing hinges arrive Saturday. That a total of 7 days to buy and erect a wardrobe.

Eventually in exasperation located a customer service phone number who explained that this message ('Some items are out of stock') actually means there are no deliveries available!!!!! STUPID OR WHAT!! I now have to try again as new delivery slots are brought in each morning, in the hope that no items go out of stock in the meantime.

"IKEA solar panel (via Wolmann), experience first 18 months. . Update October/November 2024:
For now I have moved a one star experience to a three star - based on what has happened the last month. They may go away depending on how this proceeds:
- was contacted again in August/September 2024 (!)
- a technician visited in October, the inspection was a bit so and so, but he was very happy with the roof and the space for installing 18 solar panels (8 kW) and the accumulators.
- Two weeks later I get an offer, here one have to be careful as the offer was not what I had initially asked for but for a 4.5kW system (11 panels) with 10kWh batteries (everything half of my first quote, except for the cost that was marginally less for an inferior system)
- I have informed the company that I would like the system described in the initial quote, and they are working on it. The first excuse was that I did not have a 3phase system and therefore was limited to 4.5 kW. This is wrong - no extra cables or permission is required up to ca 6.8 kW. They came back with a new proposal with 16 panels (I estimate around 6.5kW - Great!). However they say I have no space for 20kWh batteries.

Let's see how it goes, as I have a whole room free for batteries. Should they provide what I asked for 18 months ago - I would be very happy and increase the number of stars again.
---
Old, First impression:
This is a first impression trying to get a solar panel installation through IKEAs website.

The reason for going with IKEA is that they have good products at competitive prices and as they sell in quantity their quality control is generally very good.

Not so with the solar panel project.

IKEA does this together with a German sounding company Wolmann. The first impression is great, go to the IKEA site, click photo voltaic (PV) and you get a web site where you indicate your house and draw the area of your roof on the image of your neighborhood.
Based on the size and your requirement you get a written offer with the cost with ITA state subsidies already removed (sconto fattura). Yes, we went for the full package - max PV, 20kWh batteries - after discount the 34 k€ price became 17k€. Just what we wanted… but before going into pension that is.
You pay 200€ to have a technician inspect your property - and you wait.
And you wait, and you contact the German sounding company that likely is less German than you would like.
Since the offer we have waited 8 months - and I have still not had a technician come for an inspection.
I also recommended IKEA to a colleague of me, but he was smarter than me as he looked online for customer feedback first and then decided to find a local company.
His system was installed a month later…
IKEA - you need to be careful as to who you cooperate with, as experiences like this unfortunately taints your excellent track record.

Update 1/2/2023:
Eventually my wife got angry and called the IKEA subcontractor. After eight months and almost monthly solicitations they were surprised nothing had happened, and suggested to call back (they did not) and eventually refund the money (we would rather have what we ordered).
If they are not able to send a technician but refunds the money we will have lost about 17k€ in subsidies from the Italian government…
That is likely more money that we have saved with IKEA in our whole life. When we have a final solution with Wolmann I’ll make sure they get a glowing review too.
Be careful and DO NOT TRUST IKEAs collaborating companies.
Reduced from three to two star as we seem to have lost 17k€ subsidies (50%) that other companies also had offered.

Update 10 February:
After several solicitations and a process that has lasted close to 9 months - the IKEA collaborator Wolmann informs us that there are no technicians available in our area. We live in a town with 300k people, 1 hour from Genova and Pisa.
Please draw your own conclusions - but if I were you -stay away from collaborators selling their products on the IKEA site. I have lowered to one star - as it is not possible to put negative tarts.",Trustpilot_USA

"Careful with Delivery . Careful with Delivery! Having paid £50 for the express delivery (because the order size would never have gone in the car!), I'd say I'm disappointed on two counts:

- Having worked from home specifically to take delivery, I was informed on the order confirmation email that I'd be called an hour before they were due to arrive. This didn't happen, and the delivery has caught me in the middle of a work meeting that I'd have otherwise moved/rearranged.

- The service states that they'll take the delivery to any chosen room in the house, which whilst technically true, can only be done if the delivery team keep their shoes on. Considering we've got brand new carpets and don't really fancy crud being walked through them on a wet winter's day, I've asked the delivery team to slip them off before going upstairs, only to be told that is a Health & Safety breach. Guess what, I now have a fairly significant amount of furniture on the lounge floor that I'm going to have to move myself.

"Ikea is the Devil . Ikea is the devil. They have no customer service and don't care about you at all. When I initially placed my order (thousands of $$ of kitchen cabinets for use in a medical office) I was told I would have everything in 2 weeks.

Come delivery time 3 weeks after I place my order (and without notice), I only received part of my order. I call them and get the run around and was told the remainder of my order will be delivered in another week. Well, that remainder of the order was then split into 3 other shipments, then they call me saying I need to pay separate deliveries fees of $80 for each delivery!!

I receive another delivery 2 weeks later, and still missing part of the order. Then after another 2 weeks I'm told the final part of my shipment will arrive.

I post up in our new office and only 6 drawers get delivered. I still don't have the base of the cabinets. I call Ikea and they tell me they're on the truck and will be delivered that day. I wait and I wait, nothing.

I call Ikea the next day, and they said the truck had mechanical problems. I called the contracted shipping company (Select Express) and they said they never received anything from Ikea's warehouse. I call Ikea back and got a different person who confirmed they didn't leave the warehouse yet. So they lied right to my face.

Here I am 2 months after placing my order and still don't have the base cabinets.

Ohh by the way, I asked if I can just go to the local warehouse and pick up the items from there.

"""Chiquitita tell me what's wrong"" - The Fallacious Nature of IKEA Customer Services . I purchased a double bed within the last *three months* and it has broke. Customer service employees are highly condescending and arrogant, with little to no empathy, and they seem void of any human emotion at all. I have read the 365 day return and exchange policy but was being told something completely different over the phone. It is almost as if they want to make it more difficult for you to resolve your issue in the hopes that you either give up and admit defeat (loss of over 400 pounds) or spend a painstakingly long amount of time on hold listening to ABBA tunes. I have been laughed at, ridiculed, hung up on and told false information by customer service employees just because they did not want me to take the matter any further. This is absolutely shocking form such a large company, but I guess I am the fool for deciding to build a bedframe from a company who use the most substandard materials there is. I chose IKEA as I am a uni student who cannot afford to buy anything from high-end competitors but now I will probably have to fork out some cash for a new bed (from somewhere else) so I am not sleeping on the floor whilst I wait *4-5 weeks* for a RESPONSE to my enquiry for an exchange or new parts.

TL;DR- IKEA is a hit or miss, more like finding a needle in a haystack of misses.

They once again failed to deliver the package (12/27 due to a light dusting of snow) and wanted to reschedule for another week out (1/03).

I informed her if she could just reimburse me for the delivery fee, I’ll wait until 1/03 for the table, makes sense to me considering the situation NAL has put their customer in. She then informed me that she’d rather cancel the order than give me the $300. In short Ethel costed her company a $200 sale on top of the $300 delivery fee they’ve already paid to NAL.

I placed an order on 12/19 at about 7pm for a $200 gift card for my nephew. We then surprisingly received $30 in gift cards as part of their promotion. We decided that if we were going to get gift cards that we would buy my nephew a little something to go with the gift card. After much searching online, we found something that we thought would be perfect to use the $30. We placed the order at about 8:30pm.

I decided to go in and help with their short handedness by grabbing the items myself and taking them to the customer returns desk. At which time I am told once again that they are short handed and that I had to stick to their chosen schedule and that we cannot use the items that we brought (exact match) to complete our online request. After going round and round with her and the ""manager"" she contacted that came to the counter, we are told that it is just their policy and that they are not willing to work with customers. The customer would have to cancel the online order, thus requesting a refund which will take 1-3 business days, and make a new purchase by going through the normal check out. I am given similar disservice when I called the 888 number that the manager provided. What kind of customer service is this? Is it let's lie about why we don't allow customers to come at different times (short handed) until they call us out on it thus changing our story (based on assigned scheduled times)? Is it our schedule over customer needs? Don't even get me started on how many employees I saw standing around doing nothing, talking to other employees, or playing on their phones while I was navigating the store that I am sure has at least 100 signs in order to direct customers to the different areas. That's a great way to add salt in the wound of your customers as you lie to their faces with the same rehearsed story of being short handed.

I would recommend that everyone in your leadership read Moments of Magic Be a Star With Your Customers and Keep Them Forever. Perhaps then you may take a look at some of the policies that lost you this first time customer and earned you many a bad review. I will NEVER shop IKEA again and I will never gift or buy new or pre-used IKEA products. I will tell everyone I know and anyone that will listen that IKEA is too lazy and set in their ways to help a customer not to mention that IKEA trains staff to lie to try to make the business look better. I have already processed a request to cancel the $200 gift card for my nephew and I am ready to dispute it with my credit card company. I have no desire to have monetary compensation for this ridiculous event. My hope is that someone actually reads this and acts upon it.",Trustpilot_USA
"Shocking IKEA online experience... . Your online experience is absolutely shocking... ordered bed frame with headboard, mattress to go with it and a jug my wife wanted. Paid 40 pound for delivery and received mattress, headboard and jug. So ultimately I could use a jug at a cost of 40 pounds delivery.

Speaking to customer service they are unable to transfer shipment from one shop to another to avoid cancellations instead automatically cancel the missing item and processing refund. I have been refunded for bed frame not delivered, but had to re-order and pay 40 pounds delivery fee again - this seems like a money grabbing scheme and easy money you make off people. Absolute shame - you should learn from companies like Amazon how to treat you customers and their money. Pathetic.

I mentioned it before. Sales Manager had no empathy or interest in selling me the product selected by me, I had to ask her to accompany me to the place of a lamp that I needed and she told me that she could not move from her workplace, then I asked her to she helped me with a desk and she told me to go back to the place and then give her the photo of what I was interested in, I did it and I returned with her, I asked several questions because I was interested in acquiring several Products but she did not show any interest, then she I asked to apply for an IKEA Credit card so I could buy more products but she refused, saying that I had to buy more than 500 dollars to apply. If Sandra O's customer service would have been correct, I would have bought more products, but I think it was not the right service, I only bought a desk and a lamp, perhaps my purchase would have been better if my day had been with another Agent Sales

"Don't bother ordering from the online website... Go in-store instead! . Ordered a few large items (200cm tall) with express delivery as my old MALM drawers broke and needed to store my stuff as soon as possible. I was decorating my room so I had about a week wriggle room until all the stuff needed to come.

The delivery came next day but by look of the back of the van, the boxes had been thrown in. When the delivery men were taking the box's out, they landed every single box straight into mud whilst the corner of the boxes were damaged therefore damaging the items even further...

I refused delivery as it was an expensive order and they told me I had to send everything back (even the stuff that wasn't damaged) so I did.

I was later told my IKEA that I could've sent just the damaged item back...

I then called IKEA to explain what had happened to get a replacement sent out but the delivery men hadn't put down that the items were returned to sender so I needed to wait until they received confirmation.

Fine... So I waiting another day and called back up. They issued me a replacement and said it would be here the latest Thursday. I said this was fine as I needed them by Friday the latest (having ordered on the Sunday before).

Wednesday night, I get a text saying ""Your order will be delivered between 7am - 11pm"". The next day I don't get a tracking link like I did previously and the order didn't arrive.

I called up IKEA once again and asked if it was definitely arriving today, they said ""There's been a delay, it will be there between 4pm and 7pm"". I said okay and waited...

5:30pm on Thursday... Still no tracking link so I highly doubted it would arrive. I called again and they said it wasn't loaded on to the delivery van so the earliest they could get it to me was Saturday, nearly a week after my initial order.

So I asked IKEA to cancel the order and I'll just go pick it up myself (I noticed they missed off a few shelves on the replacement anyway!). This is obviously a huge inconvenience as IKEA is a 40 minute drive away...

They said it was cancelled and I'd receive my refund in 14 days.

A week later, I randomly get a text saying ""Your items will be collected tomorrow between 7am - 11pm"". So I called up again and told them I don't have any items as they were returned back to IKEA and no replacement items were sent. They assured me it was just a mistake and it was probably sent to the wrong number.

The next day I get a phone call from the delivery company asking if I needed any items collecting as they could see my initial delivery was refused. I said no, I do not need a collection as I don't have any items.

11am that day, the delivery company still arrives and I tell them I have no items and sorry their time was wasted! Even though it wasn't my fault...

Fast forward to 2 weeks after my cancellation, no sign of a refund...

So I patiently call the IKEA customer service team once again and ask if they can please issue the refund. I was apologised to and told it would be in my bank no later than Monday the 12th Dec.

Now Tuesday 13th Dec, I still have no refund, £300 right near Christmas, after having to spend a further £300 to get my items in-store and my original order was placed on 20th November.

I'm tired of having the call the IKEA CS team over and over again and absolutely nothing being done.

"MIXED THOUGHTS +/- . My thoughts about IKEA are mixed. A combination of very negative aspects and very positive ones, made me decide to give 3 stars. I'm somewhere in the middle of being satisfied and disappointed as a customer.

Negative:

- EXTREMELY bad product availability especially about PAX wardrobes. They discontinued the black frames for PAX sliding doors and I've been waiting for the new model in a loooooong time. Wouldn't it be better if they discontinue something when the replacement is ready to be available?

- EXTREMELY long waiting when you call for help (always AT LEAST half an hour and up).

- The employees at the phone customer service are very polite and cute but it seems to me that they are not competent. From the 5 or 6 times that I had to call them, only once I got to talk to someone who had actual answers. All the rest didn't know about this, had no idea about that, they weren't sure about the other, and so on..
I do not blame them though. I believe that it's a problem of leadership from IKEA's high ranked employees/partners. How can a phone customer service employee answer your questions if they don't give THEM first the information?
Example: ""When are the new dark coloured PAX panels gonna be released?"". No one ever knew..

- IKEA partners with Bring for product deliveries to homes, which is a really unreliable and full of hassle company (based on my personal experience and the dozens of bad reviews here on Trustpilot).

- The PAX wardrobe designing tool would get stuck and reset, resulting in losing all of my editing and going back to the beginning. Tested both on phone and laptop.

- The quality of most of their products is a joke but that's nothing new..

- Quite expensive delivery but I'm soft about that because IKEA's main concept is ""you get it by yourself, you build it by yourself, it's therefore cheaper"".

- The website is slow and often problematic.

- An utterly exhausting experience to stroll around the physical store since one has to walk through the whoooooole thing in order to reach to what they're looking for.

- Parts from the interior of PAX wardrobes are not discontinued but never back in stock. One plans for a wardrobe as he dreamed of it and then has to change way many things and compromise due to problematic availability.

Positive:

- Relatively affordable prices for the average hard working person who still doesn't earn much, the student and any other customer on a low budget. It gives chance to people to furnish their homes that they could not otherwise have.

- Some really nice designs in both furniture and interior accessories.

- Tasty food at their restaurant and I also love their simple ice cream.

- One can book a cost free video appointment to get advice and help about the planing of a PAX wardrobe, a bed, kitchen renovation etc. I found it helpful.

- Decent approach to a customer's complaint. I had problem with Bring who didn't deliver my order on time and the day was wasted. Then I was told that I had to wait for weeks before I could receive it! IKEA, expressing their regret for the inconvenience, managed to shortened the waiting time to one week and most impressively, compensated me with the full amount of the shipping cost (1999 kr). VERY APPRECIATED INDEED.

- Smaller convenience (but if you think about it quite important): you can store your bags in a box with a key so you don't carry them around and have weight on your back or hands.

- I haven't personally used it for my child but I give a plus for the existing playground so that the child/children don't have to tolerate the boredom of shopping and the parent/parents can shop without distractions.

- Lovely furniture presentations at the physical store and some good inspiration online. Kudos to their decorators.

All in all, I think that IKEA's results are a combination of talented designers and decorators as well as polite customer service employees and a team of people not competent enough in leadership and time & stock management.",Trustpilot_USA

"UNACCEPTABLE IKEA . This was unacceptable!
14 attempts with your Customer Service team to organise what should of been a simple replacement of two damaged side panels.  

For over 20 years we have been shopping with IKEA, purchasing many items. In the unlikely situation that there has been a problem, Ikea has always resolved the issue swiftly. 

We visited the Wembley store on Saturday 5th November and purchased various items including two IDANAS units. We put the first one together with no problems but unfortunately when it came to the second unit we were unable to build it due to these damaged panels. 

We called customer services,  waiting 40 minutes to finally speak to Aaron at 1pm on Monday the 7th November. He was very apologetic and assured us the replacement panels would come from Reading as this was the nearest store with stock.  We did not get confirmation of this but trusted all would be well.

After not receiving any emails from Ikea or Parcel Force, I rang customer services on Thursday the 10th November waiting 30 minutes until 12.15 when I spoke with Sebastian who again was very apologetic and informed me that the order had been ""stuck in the system "". She called the duty manager at Reading to authorise the order and said it would be picked on Friday the 11th and requested for it to be delivered on Monday the14th November.  I asked for email confirmation of this which she kindly did.

Monday arrived and no delivery and no communication from either Ikea or Parcel Force.  

I called customer service on that Monday the 14th, waiting 30 minutes before speaking with Rachel at 12.40pm who was very short in her manner, not allowing me to finnish a sentence. I was trying to explain that we were expecting a delivery on that day and that we had heard nothing. Her response was to blame the other agent and that she had given us the wrong information! The parts had not even been picked yet and now they were coming from Wembley and would take 7 days to be delivered after being picked.

when I asked to speak to a Manager, her response was that they would not be able to help. I asked again to speak with a Manager and was told it would be 72 hours and they would only call if they could help, which they couldn't. 

This was extremely disappointing to hear as there was most definitely a problem that needed to be resolved. 

On the 17th November I called customer services and spoke with Sebastian at 9.15am as no communication from Ikea or Parcel Force. Sebastian was as baffled as me. she informed me that the parts had not been collected and that Wembley didn't even have stock.

Yet again we were waiting for a delivery that would never arrive!

She booked it with Croydon.
After not receiving any communication from Parcel Force again i called customer services and spoke with Josh Also on the 17th November at 5.53pm waiting about 20 minutes. 
I just needed a clarification it was picked and Parcel Force had it and also wanted an email address i could send a complaint to as the one supplied by Sebastian was not working. He asked me to send the email to him and he would forward it on.

I called after hearing nothing on Monday the 21st of November and spoke with Rida at 12.29pm after a 30 minute wait. 
She informed me it was picked and Parcel Force would deliver that day. She confirmed this in an email to me. 

After no delivery I called the customer service team on the 22nd November and spoke with Muhammad at 9.45am after a 25 minute wait and he informed me Parcel Force now had the panels and it would take up to 4 days. I asked to speak with a Manager but he was unable to do this. He did however say he would forward it to his manager.  I asked if the Manager would contact me and for a email of our conversation.  

I waited until the 25th of November and this time my girlfriend called and
spoke with 2 different Customer service agents as the first Nabil dropped the call after 30 minutes, didn't call back. The second Shake basically said there was nothing she could do without pictures!
I then called and spoke with Remi and after 30 minutes the call dropped, he never called back. Then I spoke with Darren. He informed me that the order was stuck in the system. Seriously nearly 4 weeks.. I had to ask him to call Wembley Ikea and check stock and that I would go there myself. After a total of nearly 3 more hours ( 8 hours in total) I got permission to go and pick up the replacements for the damaged pannels myself!

Actually, my order was remade, in store, with an associates ""help"", and they did not disclose to me that my bed frame would require additional separately sold items.
I'm still in my condo, another night, sleeping on the floor.

After speaking to numerous representatives in the Resolution department and post delivery department, all they could say is ""sorry...please leave a review.."".

After two weeks with no contact I called ikeas appalling customer service that they would gladly rearrange the delivery but I would be charged the delivery charge again despite having no choice in delivery tîe and no option to halt it. I was subsequently given incorrect information and just a generally infuriating experience from a rude agent who was intent on sharing details of IKEA s process. He could not escalate the problem, he could not email a form, he refused to escalate the call telling me he would decide what needed to be escalated and on. Never ever again they are cheap and now you know why. Certainly the worst customer service.

"Problems with quality, ordering, delivery and customer service . I wanted to write something a couple of months ago, but unfortunately my list of issues with Ikea just keeps increasing. We've spent €€€€ on Ikea furniture since September and had a staggering number of issues with ordering, delivery, product quality and customer support:

- The iOS app has a permanent error message at the top and it is frequently unable to load my order history
- We spent €1000 on a PAX unit and were told the day before delivery that two drawers were indefinitely out of stock, despite the fact that we designed the unit specifically with items that were in stock. After the out of stock message, there was no option to choose alternative items - just a take it or leave it option.
- If you choose the option to have the missing items delivered later, it's converted into a separate order which is not added to your account, has no ability to track the status, and for which you will receive no automatic updates.
- The above items are now available in-store for new customers but still not shipping to those who have already paid.
- Most of the furniture we did receive was filthy inside the boxes. Not on the outside, literally inside. Covered in dust and in some places dirt that needed to be scrubbed off: PAX, Besta, Kallax and Lommarp units. €€€€ and you have to clean it all first.
- Our Lommarp unit came with the wrong wooden parts (one was duplicated), meaning we couldn't assemble it. The entire unit needed to be replaced and we waited over a week for a collection and replacement.
- Many Ikea items have stickers that don't come off easily. They crumble and leave glue residue underneath them. This means you need to spend time peeling them off in pieces and then googling how to clean glue off before spending time scrubbing.
- Many parts have cosmetic issues in places: scratches, crumbling paint and in the case of our Vimle sofa, burns around one of the holes that made it extremely difficult to attach the bolts.
- The functional design from product to product is inconsistent. Some units have adapters for skirting boards (Besta) and some don't (PAX). The adapters are, however, poorly designed because even at their smallest size, they're too big for many skirting boards.
- The delivery tracking links don't work on mobile, which is terrible when you're expecting a 7am delivery. You should be able to check the link from bed, but instead need to use a laptop or desktop computer.
- Some tracking links don't work on any devices because the URLs are broken. Since none of their tracking links are available in the apps, there is nowhere else to check. So a delivery window from 7am-2pm is a complete lottery.
- The delivery is unreliable as the delivery windows aren't always respected by the logistics companies. They show up outside of the delivery/collection window without calling beforehand. In our case we weren't home, and had planned our day around the collection window.
- The delivery company is supposed to phone an hour beforehand, which never happens. In some instances we received less than 10 minutes notice.
- Important information is sent by email by customer support but there is never the option to reply to them.
- The chat button on their website doesn't work at all on Safari on macOS
- The chat tool often disconnects and you need to start completely from scratch, sometimes after 20+ minutes of chatting.
- You cannot upload images to the chat tool, meaning if you're reporting a fault or damaged parts, you need to try to describe it rather than simply sending a photo
- They will collect unwanted items within 14 days, but this isn't mentioned anywhere when filling out the returns forms. We missed it and had to pay for a 3rd party.

I regret using Ikea and given the chance to buy this much furniture again, I would buy everything elsewhere.",Trustpilot_USA
"Worst Delivery Service . This is regarding the abysmal delivery service on an online order, with delivery booked for 5:00 to 9:00 PM, Friday November 11.

Our apartment building requires us to book the service elevator for deliveries like this due to the size of the parcels and the potential for damage inside the elevators. I had booked it for 6:00 to 9:00 PM accordingly.

At 8:07 AM, I received a text from the delivery movers saying: ""Hey its your ikea delivery for today,i was wondering if someone can be at the delivery address around 10-11we will be in your area around that if you can be there it will save us alot of time, if so it will be very appreciated Thanx for your time .please reply to confirm.st josesph"".

No one was going to be available from 10-11 AM because my partner and I were at work. We had booked the 5-9PM slot because that is when we were available to be home to receive the delivery. I did not see this message until around 10:30 AM. This was the only message received from the delivery contractors that day.

My partner and I received a call from our building's concierge at 10:20 AM letting us know that some IKEA delivery contractors showed up with all the packages and told him that I gave them permission to come at that time to do the delivery. I absolutely had not given permission. They proceeded to come up to our floor and dump all the parcels in the apartment hallway outside our unit.

This was not our first IKEA delivery, we knew that the delivery movers often come outside of the given window. But this was a 7 whole hours outside the booked delivery window. This was absurd.

The movers did not use the service elevator, which is padded and inspected before and after moves, which meant that we, as the registered unit tenants would be liable for any damages that may have happened (more likely in the smaller, unpadded elevators). The big parcels blocking up the hallway were also fire hazards, which we could have been fined for had our building concierge not informed us immediately. My partner and I had to rush home from work to move the packages inside.

Every part of this experience was infuriating and not what I expect from an IKEA furniture delivery.

I reached out to customer service on their website but the only options were to call in or chat with a bot. I hate this trend of corporations being greedy and cheap by trying to force you to talk to a useless bot instead of an actual person via email. They refused to refund the delivery fee ($60) because ""the service already happened"" and upon pressing further, offered a $50 IKEA gift card which I refused.

"Never Buying IKEA Again . This is the first time I've ever ordered from IKEA and it will most certainly be the last. I ordered a sectional couch and the night before it was scheduled to arrive, I received an email that said half of it was out of stock. I was refunded for the out of stock piece, but the other half of the couch was still sent. What am I supposed to do with half of a couch? Why send it at all? My wife and I spent over 2 hours putting together the half that arrived before realizing that something was wrong. This is when I checked my email and saw what had been sent the night prior. I then called customer service for a refund and to have the useless half couch picked up. I was told to take all of the pieces apart that we had spent hours putting together and to try to get it back into the boxes. Everything took up so much space in my house that it prevented me from ordering another couch from a more reputable company. It took days before someone finally came and picked everything up. Once they did, I thought the saga was over until a month later I discovered that I had STILL not been refunded for the useless half couch that should never have been sent in the first place. I called customer service once again to inquire about my refund and was told the systems were down and to try again later. The next day I called again and was told that I could finally expect my refund in 5-10 business days. Well, today I checked my credit card statement and it appears while I was refunded a portion, I am still missing over $250 dollars. I just had to call customer service AGAIN to ask where the rest of my money is and they have been unable to figure it out. They had to open up a case to have it looked into. Who knows when that will be? At this point I've paid IKEA a few hundred dollars for doing nothing except wasting my time.

"IKEA Birmingham. Like 3/4 of the reviews... Appalling Customer Service . Like 3/4 of the reviews, customer service is appalling. I purchased 2 cellular blinds knowing I had to trim to fit the width of the recess in the window. I used a Stanley knife to carefully cut the tape used to seal the box it came in.
The instructions were hiding the mechanism so it wasn't until I could see it, that I didn't have enough space left to cut the blind. I sealed the blind back and made my way back to IKEA.
The customer service lady took both blinds off me and in front of me, used a biro pen to open the box, she damaged the box in the process and then said she would need to check if it could go back in the store for resale. She came back and said, as it had been opened, it can't go back in store. I was offered a voucher or 70% refund for BOTH blinds. I asked to speak to her manager who promptly came. He said that both blinds were opened? Clearly, the customer service lady opened up the sealed blind and I argued this point, all I got was the same 70% or vouchers! I asked to see the returns policy for opened items, the manager showed me the policy for unopened items but the policy for opened items was ""still being drafted"". So I said, so there's no policy in force then! After several arguments the manager agreed to give me a voucher and a full refund for the blind that was damaged by the biro. Still not happy and I could have got trading standards involved etc but for £30 I couldn't be bothered.

Great day at IKEA Dublin yesterday with… . Great day at IKEA Dublin yesterday with adult son and daughter . Started with a lovely coffee in Swedish coffee shop and headed up for browse through showrooms. Met with really helpful team to advise and help design PAX fitted wardrobe providing printouts of our shopping list and our design summary. Headed for lovely lunch then in the busy cafe to re energise before collecting our wardrobe requirements and proceeding to checkout . Checkout team very cheerful and helpful and directed us to delivery dept . Couldn’t believe our purchase would be delivered to Co Kilkenny the next morning (Sun) . Received text giving approx delivery time and able to track the expected arrival time which was incredibly precise at 10.04am thanks to André and Obi (sorry if we misspelt your names 😟) . Thank you to all Ikea team for great shopping experience. Everyone so helpful and friendly 👏👏. All completed and delivered well within 24 hrs of us leaving home on Sat. Well done to all !! 👍👍,Trustpilot_USA
"Never again . Ordered an expensive corner sofa in store, it was to come in 2 deliveries, the woman spent some time getting the deliveries on the same day. The deliveries came and the drivers checked every box off carefully. The next morning we took our old sofa to the dump and got started opening boxes to find that the corner piece is missing, rendering the whole sofa useless. I spent an hour and 10 minutes waiting for ikea to answer the phone to be told by an offensively cheerful youth that oops, sorry, we should have sent you an email and the corner unit would be with you in 10 days - he maintained his sunny and cheerful disposition throughout, even when I explained that I'm disabled, exhausted from moving house and in a great deal of pain, and I desperately need a comfortable place to rest, he didn't seem bothered at all. I burst into tears. My husband would have driven anywhere to get that corner unit for me but no it's not in any store, no you can't collect it from the warehouse, no it can't be delivered from the warehouse to a store, no exceptions can be made, you cannot have the one piece that makes your very expensive sofa useable, you must sit in your wheelchair for 10 long days with no break, with your bones shifting further out of place, trapping your nerves so your legs feel scalded with boiling water. Oopsie, it'll take you months to recover will it? Oh dear, can't have your visitors who were going to help you unpack, because there's nowhere to sit and you can't ask folks in their 70s to sit on the floor? Not to worry, the corner piece will be with you in 10 days, have a lovely day and here's a £20 voucher, don't spend it all at once. Ikea just don't give a ****.",Trustpilot_USA

"Horrible . Horrible. I had a pick-up order and they gave me the wrong item. I called them and they started a case on it and asked them to deliver the right product to me since it was their mistake. After 45 days I called them again and they said that the only way to remedy it would be to physically go into the store myself which was going to be a pain since I didn’t have a car. And, they said that I couldn’t speak to anyone about it so that was their final decision. They are horrible with customers. Once you buy something, make sure it’s the right thing because otherwise you’re screwed.",Trustpilot_USA
"I am a 99% online shopper . I am a 99% online shopper. I have frequently made purchase and returned items to other stores with no problem. However, that is not true with Ikea. First off, they do not provide free return shipping. After paying $17.00 to return the items to the closet store near me, and waiting 2 weeks, I called customer service, waiting 10 minutes to talk to representative. I was then informed, that even though my package was delivered 2 weeks earlier, it wasn't processed until 2 days ago because they had ""other returns. Now I have to wait up to another 14 days from now for my refund. All in all , it will take about a month when other sites take days. My advice, only order from Ikea if you're positive you are going to keep it. Very disappointed and will not be ordering from them again!",Trustpilot_USA
"Customer service - dealing with queries and complaints is atrocious . I have always held Ikea brand in high esteem. However, what has just happened is an instance of shocking incompetence and downright rudeness! I received an Ikea Credit contract, on which is clearly reads that I can submit it in Ikea Store. As a person residing in Germany, without a German ID, I was required to present a confirmation of residency, however, the contract also outlined documents like, mobile plan contract, salary receipt, etc. Upon arrival it was first confirmed by a friendly employee but a second later another one declined my contract and told me to obtain the confirmation of residency first.
I contacted Ikea customer service subsequently, and the lady in chat said I didn't need proof of residency after all. She still sounded unsure and asked me to get in touch with the bank (IKANO) and abruptly ended the chat, without waiting to hear from me at all!!! I was stunned! This is incredibly disrespectful and downright rude! I filed a complaint through Ikea Online contact form and received a phone call from them. Again, the person on the other end was not sure as to whether I needed the damn proof of residency or not!!! I can't believe that a brand like Ikea can have such incompetent customer service, especially that it was a simple yes/no question.

"Don't advertise services that won't get done! . I ordered 5 bookshelves online to be delivered and taken to the third floor, when the delivery driver got here he did not buzz the security door (as instructed) and when I heard him banging on the door I went down and he said in a rude tone, you never answered your phone and walked away. I was working so I left my daughter to direct them where to take the boxes but when she asked them to take them to the 3rd floor as requested he said No, IKEA does not let us do that (even though it was given to me as an option). The long boxes are now all sitting in the main kitchen area and since I am not allowed to lift anything I can not move them for 6 weeks and it is very awkward getting around them. I think I should get a refund on at least the delivery fee and have someone take them to where they were supposed to go in the first place.",Trustpilot_USA

So we were going to have to disassemble the dresser and take a four hour drive to return it? It wasn’t feasible. Then they said they would review a refund, we even sent pictures.

"Korken seals . Today I contacted customer service, on the one occasion I have asked for help in countless years of purchases from furniture to storage and market place items. I made a large investment over several years in Korken, kitchen storage jars. These are displayed on the sales page with preserves in them. I think as preserving jars they are fabulous and take the strain of water bathing for safe canning. They are easily checkable after for the perfect seal. I have never broken on in the several years of using them.
You might wonder why only one star review!
Packs of 5 rubber replacement seals vanished from the shelves about 18 months ago. I was fobbed off in store with the idea they were probably in one of those shipping containers. Last time I visited (6 months ago) I asked another real, live person ---- not they weren't in stock. Today, in the busy months of preserving, I asked online.
First I dealt with Billie Bot --- going in silly circles. Finally even Billie Bot quit in favour of a person and Philippe came online. Philippe was courteous and polite, but unable to offer any customer service whatsoever. Like Billie Bot there were quotations of the company policy - it is discontinued, products become unavailable, Ikea holds the right to withdraw products. An apology only when I explained how much I have invested in this glassware (plus all the other preserving materials like canning pans etc) and a promise to pass my complaint on. I ask how this will work and when a response is expected. Basically the response could be translated ' that the item is discontinued so i will just tell someone you are disgruntled and they will ignore you'. What a company, that can't offer real customer service or offer resolution. Ikea has lost my custom totally now -- no more purchases at all. Beware if you think they look good and cheaper than Kilner...that's where it stops, maybe Kilner have a better customer service. I haven't yet sourced rubber or something akin to the thickness of these seals (I have been looking since the last in person visit to store). I think it must be rubbish to have a customer service role if you can't offer customer service, but I guess the initial purchases are the only interest...sad.",Trustpilot_USA

Let us give you a $25 gift card. Well that was not what I wanted but fine. I only mention it because it never came either. So they then say that I will get my rug on Friday. The next day I get a text saying that my rug will be delivered between 12 &4. I’m at work! Ya know so that I can buy rugs! I’m done with all of this so I call and waste more time canceling my order. I want a refund. I’m done. So she says 3-5 days for my refund. Well guess what? That request was never sent through so after 8 days I call. I’m told that it takes 10 days. WHAT? After 11 days I call again I’m told that the request was never sent through. I ordered the item on August 24th it’s September 20th and I have nothing.

"Horrendous is an understatement . Horrendous is an understatement. I've spent 6.5 hours on the phone with their incompetent, rude, and careless customer service, riddled with people that don't know what they're doing. Ikea used to be great, and that greatness died along with its founder. Aside from the fact that they are wasting my time, and company time, by causing so much time to go down into the dregs of the toilet, they are also wasting their own resources, which I could care less about, by having their delivery partners drive all the way to my house on multiple occasions (3 companies, twice each, amounting to 6 trips), only for me to turn them away, because Ikea dropped the ball and didn't cancel/reschedule themselves, as discussed. I'm providing these delivery partners with reference numbers, names, and dates, so they can be compensated for their wasted time that Ikea couldn't care less about. I messaged Ikea on instagram (at Ikea's public request in the comments), and they have gone unanswered; emails to customer service have gone unanswered, chat reps pass the buck and transfer you around until you give up---two weeks of this with no resolution in sight. My best option is to file a charge back with my bank. I would have been better off splurging on expensive furniture from Crate and Barrel and CB2, with all of the time I wasted with Ikea---their cheap, flat-box, formaldehyde off-gassing furniture just isn't worth it.",Trustpilot_USA
"Welcome to Dante's Ninth Level of Hell . If you MUST buy IKEA, go to their stores. Online is pure torture. Website ordering has flaws that will bite you. Customer service has minimal information and knowledge. Delivery dates are meaningless. Details: Moved daughter into off-campus apartment. Found two HAVSTRA products she wanted. They are ""real wood"", not the typical compressed sawdust. Wood is mediocre quality. Not the clear grade wood in quality furniture. However, knots and such are fairly well hidden since they use paint, not stain, to color the wood. If you get dark color, any dings, etc. will be very visible. They also do not paint the back side so you have to place against a wall or have raw wood visible. Instructions are pictures only so no way to communicate any warnings beyond one or two basics. The ""quicklock"" screws MUST go in exactly straight. Remove and retry if they start going crooked, otherwise you will split the wood. Pre-drilled holes are inconsistent in size. One dowel will be completely loose and another will be a struggle to get in. Alignment was accurate enough to assemble joints but some needed some real effort. Either save money and buy self-assemble furniture at Walmart or buy real furniture from a real furniture store. Decided to order online and have shipped because items came in boxes weighing 60+ pounds according to their website. You enter delivery instructions in a box. There is actually a character limit but if you exceed it, the box turns red and you get ""information entered not in expected format"" message. Customer service was clueless and while on extended hold while they tried to find out what that meant, I managed to figure it out. After submitting order, you never see your delivery instructions again in any IKEA emails. Had specified Sept. 9 delivery date on order placed twelve days earlier. Sept. 5 email said order had shipped with Sept. 9 delivery. On Sept. 7, delivery confirmation received with delivery date field blank. Why send email saying delivery is confirmed then? Turned out blank meant not being delivered. Did not receive call on Sept. 8 with delivery time window that I was told to expect. Called delivery vendor (GoBolt in my area) on Sept. 9 and found myself in heaven. They are polar opposite of IKEA. They were the ones that told me nothing was being delivered that day. They only know they have an IKEA delivery to make when the motor freight truck delivers it to them. They get no notification from IKEA. They explained the entire process and answered every question. Prior call that morning to IKEA customer service was useless and hung up after being put on hold for 3-4 times. Also, you MUST have exact order number for IKEA to ATTEMPT to help. They have no way to look it up. On the evening of 9th, noticed I had another delivery confirmation email from that aternoon and the delivery date was NOT blank. Had Sept 13. First thing following Monday, called GoBolt again. They confirmed they did have my order to deliver the next day. Gave me a four hour delivery window and my place in the delivery queue. Confirmed that they actually received my delivery instructions from IKEA too. On morning of 13th, received a link from GoBolt that let me track the delivery truck. After completing delivery prior to me, driver texted me that they were on the way to me. Delivery was fast, courteous and very professional. GoBolt was wonderful but I will never buy from IKEA ever again for the rest of my life.",Trustpilot_USA

"Beware of buying IKEA Floor Models . I left IKEA Renton with a functioning clock today. But first I was told by 3 IKEA employees that I had to go home with a totally broken, unusable item that cost $50.99. The reason? The item was sold As-Is.
I interacted with 2 IKEA employees when I purchased this item. The website was reporting that there were 4 of these clocks in stock, but there were none. I asked a salesperson about this and she asked if I wanted to buy the floor model and I said Yes. She directed me to another part of the store where another employee took the clock, then gave it back to me, without a word. He gave me a tag that said in huge black letters on a yellow background: $50.99. The original price was $59.99. I didn’t think this was much of a discount, but I didn’t say anything.
When I got home, I printed the instructions from the IKEA website, and I inserted new batteries. According to the instructions, the numbers were supposed to start flashing, but they didn’t. I tried to insert a USB cable, but it would not go in. The instructions did not say what kind of cable to use and it didn’t come with a cable. The clock did not work at all.
I prepared to return the item. I got the tag and receipt. Now that I had my glasses on, I could see that the tag said in very small letters, under the price, “ASIS Non-Refundable.” I didn’t think that would be a problem. I wasn’t planning to ask for a refund. I just wanted a store credit. I assumed that a reputable company like IKEA would issue a store credit for an item that was totally broken. I never imagined that a company like IKEA would expect me to pay $50.99 for merchandise that was unusable. But I was mistaken.
I went to the Returns area 2 weeks later and told the IKEA employee that called my name that I would like a store credit for an item that was broken. She said it was As-Is so she could not take it back. I explained that no one told me it was As-Is and As-Is was printed in tiny letters that I didn’t see because I did not have my glasses on. She called a manager in Recovery and when she hung up, she handed the clock back to me and said they would not give me a store credit.
I said that was unacceptable, and that I wanted to talk to the Recovery manager.
The Recovery manager came out and was insulting. She reiterated that the item was As-Is and said several times that I had waited “a month” to return it. I bought it exactly 2 weeks prior. She said I could put on my glasses, turn over the receipt, and read the As-Is policy which is printed on the back. She said they would not give me a refund. I said I didn’t ask for a refund, that I wanted a store credit. She said no. I said that is unacceptable, I want to talk to your manager.
Soon a third IKEA employee came over to talk to me. She pointed out that the area I went to to get the tag 2 weeks ago, had a sign that says As-Is.
1. I didn’t notice the sign
2. Even if I did, I would not know that it applied to me because no one said As-Is to me, only Floor Model.
3. Even if I was told the clock was As-Is, I would still expect a store credit if the item turned out to be totally broken and unusable.
She said IKEA’s As-Is policy is very strict. I said, if that’s your policy, and you are going to enforce it with no exceptions, you need to train your employees to explain that to customers. She said I had waited “over a month” to return it. It was, in fact, exactly 2 weeks. She also referenced the fact that the clock had been “deeply discounted.” The clock was discounted less than 10%. Since it didn’t come with the cable included with new clocks, I would have to purchase one, which really makes the discount closer to 5%. That is not a deep discount. Eventually she took the clock in the back, and returned with it in about 2 minutes. It was working. I asked what they did and she said they just put batteries in it. I put new batteries in it and it did not work, so I don’t know what happened.
IKEA clearly puts time and effort into training it’s employees to enforce its As-Is policy even when circumstances make it unethical to do so, as they were in my case today. It may be legal. It is not ethical.
IKEA needs to redirect some of the energy it puts into training employees to enforce the As-Is policy, into training employees to make the As-Is policy clear to customers before they buy one of these items. For example, “This is a floor model which means it is sold As-Is which means it cannot be returned, even for store credit, even if you find it doesn’t work at all.”
I couldn’t even throw it in the trash because it requires special disposal.
I wanted to put this in writing and submit it to IKEA, but when I called customer service I was told that there is no email or physical mailing address for IKEA.
I do like my clock very much.",Trustpilot_USA

I ordered few stuff 2 different sizes Pax wardrobe and when I was almost finish building it ( this is the the 100cm length ), then I saw the the right under part and other things is broken so it can effect the wardrobe it’s self to stand. I called the call center right away to complain about it and they agreed to change the whole package. Then I opened the second package from Pax wardrobe 50cm length and check it right away then I found out exactly the same broken part. It was funny because the broken part it’s on the same place but from the packaging doesn’t have hole. It means the didn’t check it right before the did the packaging and send it to the customers. Then I called the call center again that I want to cancel so they can take the stuff back and the want me to pay for pick up arrangement. It’s not my fault that this happens, it’s their faults not to check the the goods before they sending it. What kind of service is that? I paid the delivery service it’s self already 89,99 euros and now they want me to pay for pick up even though it’s not my mistake???? Pleas IKEA, if you don’t want to get any complain do the quality control correctly. I will not complain if I’m satisfied with the goods but because this is not the first it’s happened to me that’s why I’m very disappointed and angry.

The guys who finally brought the second half of my delivery were worse than useless. Complained about everything and left it to us to bring up. We paid £40 for delivery and did not receive a good service. Spent hours (literally) on the phone sorting the deliveries out only for this.

Ikea kitchens are well rated on Which.com, which is why I purchased one. But be warned - ikea do not manufacture any of their appliances.

"The Ikea support line is disappointing... . I don't usually bother writing reviews, but calling the Ikea customer support line has just been so frustrating regarding my replacement delivery, I really wanted to say something. Especially when I finally got my store's direct number, and realized that calling the store is like unbelievably less painful and stressful?? Like the difference was astonishing, my brain could not even fully process in the moment how easily my issue was resolved, compared to the call agents that almost seemed like they have no idea what to do. Then also, why has none of the 10+ call agents I talked to considered giving me the store's direct phone number? Or tell me to consider going to the store directly? Instead, I was trying so hard to work with them, telling them the same issue over and over again, only to get hung up on, left on hold, or ending up with no solutions or answers.

The issue was my replacement delivery didn't happen in the time frame, or day that NGL (their delivery company) gave me, which was supposed to be 8am to 12pm. I even called at around 11:30am to double check, and they said it would arrive within 15 minutes. Then it was past 12pm and it still didn't arrive...I had to leave, so I called my apartment office to check again at around 2pm, and it STILL didn't arrive. On top of that, nobody called or emailed me to inform me. I had to call NGL again to know that they wouldn't be able to make the delivery that day. Then they told me to call again to ask about the new delivery date, but when I called again, they said that it got cancelled. So I had to try figuring out what happened from the support line, and like I said earlier, was very frustrating and not very helpful.

Overall, just very disappointing considering all the hype and good things I hear about Ikea.",Trustpilot_USA

Paid at the casserie all good and beautiful so far. On the order confirmation I have the last delivery date as well as the assembly date. I mention the fact that the IKEA employee in the store asked me repeatedly if the date set for delivery and the time are ok, which gave me the impression that they are very prop, which in fact did not happen. On the day the delivery was due, no one contacted me and since then I started making phone calls with the call center (customer service). to find out that nothing is known about my order and that the logistics department is not responding to any requests from them. In the meantime I said to call the courier company PRO NATUR where I talked to a lady and she told me that they do not have a pick-up order from IKEA. And so IKEA has been walking for more than a few days with the fact that nothing is known about the order, where it is or what happened to it. In addition to this, after I placed the order and paid it a week away, I am called to be told that some products are no longer in stock, as I when I ordered them (i expected that since you order to be booked at that time).....

Honestly, after this experience, this is the last time I call on their services. My experience is 0 with them and their services for which they boast are 0. L.E.
I was yesterday on 22.08.2022 in the IKEA Baneasa store to report that the furniture is not delivered and I would like to know what is happening.

The money for the transport was returned to me. They probably felt ei...in fine. Today the surprise did not arrive the order, Fact that made me go again to IKEA Baneasa to find out that you can not deliver the order and that it is a problem that I do not know what product disappeared from stock and I can not livra...in the conditions in which yesterday it was on stock..anyway I had to go again convincing work with them to get that order once... they told me they'd arrive today, i'm curious if it would happen. I come back with the final experience. It seems to me a purely Romanian comedy as only we know how to make...... (that is, how to make a better fool of the client :) ).
L.E.-2: The order was finally delivered and from the discussion with the delivery guys we learned that it happens extremely often at least in the last year that the orders are late. The transport guys were at IKEA Baneasa this morning and they were waiting to pick up the shipment just that I could not because of a product that said it was not in stock only that suddenly they found it by magic...anyway I hope you will figure out what you are dealing with if you want to order. It is possible that the same thing will happen to you and I honestly do not know how they behave with customers who are outside Bucharest. I live 5km from IKEA Baneasa and I had such an experience.

When opening a chat they tell you to reach out to customer support via phone. After waiting for 30 minutes, you get someone who does not speak english. They will transfer you to an English speaking agent. After waiting another 15 minutes they simply hang up the phone. After going through this 5 times you finally talk to someone.

Next day checking for the estimated delivery time and part of the delivery is still set for the wrong date. Going through the above again before getting someone on the phone. This agents tells us nothing is changed in the system but he will do it for us. All looks fixed, again. However, next day still nothing changed in the account and we're the day before the estimated delivery day. Again going through the above, this person promising us to change the date. All looks fixed, again x2.

Off course, they try to deliver the parcels on the wrong date even though we've been told 3 times the date was changed. After the delivery attempt they write you an email saying you'll have to pay for the return cost because nobody was at home.

Once we have planned our kitchen, we had preinstallation person come in to take measurements. After the installer guy came to have a look at the kitchen and take measurements. I believe it was June 2021 . We were happy to go ahead book installation (at that point was supposed to be September October) Unfortunately we were not able to do so as parts of the kitchen were not available. Once parts become available we were able to book installation date. We been given installation date for January.
At that point we were frustrated as it been taken months so we wanted to cancelled the whole order. I called in and asked to cancelled the order the person said they will see what they can do and if they can bring the date forward. When she got back to me she said the order ( whole of the kitchen will be deliver 29th August ) and the installation will happen first week in September . Days to go to September nobody got back to be so I tried to chase up. I got answer it was a mistake and the installation is still happening in January .
So I called again to cancelled. Again I was told they will bring the installation forward. So they did to December. The installer guy came . Checked the measurements and said its wrong. How frustrating. Me again trying to contact ikea to sort out the issue. It took several emails once I got an answer.

I called the customer service to point out that it could not work from me but in order not to postpone this again I asked that at least the delivery be planned in the window between 5 and 9 pm. Ikea confirmed they could.
On August 4, I received another email at 12.30, while in the office, to say that the delivery had been failed as I was not at home.
I called the customer service again, complaining about it and asking that it be rescheduled the following day.
They gave me August 12 as first available date (again a week day) and told me they had raised a complaint to see if it was possible to have them before.
On 5 August I received an email saying that the order would be delivered on that day. I stayed home all day to receive a tea spoon. The bed, the couch, all the kitchen stuff basically everything else was missing (so 2 days wasted at home nothing at this point).
On August 12 I decided to work remotely to make sure the delivery was not failed again.
No one showed up, no one rang the bell, no one tried to call me. I received an email saying the delivery was delayed and another one saying it was failed.
I called the customer service number again and apparently there was nothing they could do to get in touch with the NAL group.
Generally the NAL Group handling deliveries for IKEA does not pick up the phone, does not respond on the website chat and does not get back to emails. It is practically unreachable.
Ikea and NAL group do not pass information coming from customer.
I will never ever buy anything at IKEA again and I strongly discourage anyone from doing it.
Not only you don’t get the furniture, but you waste money and a lot time.
They ended up causing damages to me.
I slept on an inflatable mattress for one month because every week I was told the delivery would have come. I wasted three full days at home for nothing.
I need to buy all the furniture again.

After going through 3 different people and explaining i got hung up on and a lady named Tiffany who i dont know how got to be in customer services says do you want to reschedule or cancel? After taking off work using my time I now only have an option of a far out delivery dTe because the transporters didnt put it on the truck?? How is this the customers fault.

I went online and ordered my daughter a dresser. We go the store to shop and pick it up. When I went to pick up the dresser we are told “ it will take a while because I was unlucky and it just tastes a little while to get it.” I wait with my wife and two little children, 8 and 5 for over an hour. Without telling me any updates I watch everyone behind me get their items and I was left as the only person after closing hours to still never receive my product. They tell me the dresser is in a restricted area and I had to wait until all the customers in the store leave the building before I can get my dresser. No apologies, no offer of anything to try to make a bad situation better. They tell me it’s just bad luck. I speak to 2 managers and one says he can offer me 20 bucks for the inconvenience. Lol. My kids are tired and hungry and I send my family to go to dinner while I stay behind waiting for the entire store to close while they finally bring me my dresser. I am now to wait outside with no lights with my product and they say sorry again we just can’t do anything to earn your business back and can’t offer anything for our mistake and apologies and I’m told 4 times they did nothing wrong and that’s just how the company works.

"I ordered a SONGESAND King-Size Bed… . I ordered a SONGESAND King-Size Bed Frame, a VESTMARKA Sprung Mattress, LURÖY Slatted Bed Base, SKORVA Midbeam and some LAPPTÅTEL Pillows.

All of this totalled £434.00. I ordered it on 25th July and paid an additional £50 for ""express"" delivery for which I was given an option of delivery the following day, 26th July, which was ideal because we were expecting an elderly couple visiting us to arrive on 27th July. How pleased we were that Ikea were providing us ""the wonderful everyday"".

The following day, I checked a few times on my tracker, the progress of my order. When we got to around 2pm and the items were still shown as ""packing your order"" I began to suspect all was not well. I called Ikea and the lady I spoke to called the local store from where the order was coming from (Wembley store) to find out what was wrong. Having hung on the phone for a considerable time whilst being at work (yes, some of us have to so we can pay for Ikea purchases), I was told that the order had been prepared but the delivery company had not collected the items. No one, either the lady I was speaking with, nor anyone at the store, could provide any explanation as to why they had not been collected.

However, the lady I was speaking to re-processed my order, sending me an email verification, to say that the order would be delivered the following day, 27th July. I received the confirmation and eagerly awaited delivery. I took time off work so that the bed could be fully assembled before our visitors arrived. Whilst all these arrangements were being made, I received another email for my order, this time stating I had not paid for the items and changing the order number. I phoned again and spoke to a different lady. We examined both orders and she went away to gain an explanation from the store as to why this order had been amended. After 30 minutes, I was told that no one at the store could provide any explanation, the named person on the order was not available and that now, my order was not going to be delivered today (27th) but would ""definitely"" be delivered tomorrow (28th). I explained the difficulties this was causing me but was told that nothing could be done. It was at this point that I was offered the opportunity to have a full refund which I declined as it would leave me in the lurch as to obtaining the new bed and probably more practical difficulties in finding a replacement. I stated I would be in touch when I was in possession of the goods, understandably sceptical that the bed would arrive.

That evening, our elderly visitors had to sleep on the couch (an ikea couch, ok for sitting, atrocious for sleeping). Because of the nature of our son's disability, it was not possible for them to have our bed.

On 28th, the bed finally arrived.

I have called Ikea today. The person I was speaking to offered me a £30 gift voucher as compensation. I felt I was entitled to a little more, given the rubbish nature of the ""express"" delivery. He went off to consult with his team leader and after 15 minutes, I was told that nothing further would be offered. I declined the £30 gift voucher as I do not intend to use Ikea again for anything.

Clearly, I should have used Trustpilot before ordering but I have to say, I was genuinely taken aback by the rating and sheer number of poor reviews on here for Ikea. So, we've had all this inconvenience, my extended time on the phone dealing with these matters (2.5 hours total) and an elderly couple complaining of back pain and Ikea won't even consider giving me back my £50 for the delivery.

I'm sorry Ikea, perhaps with the sheer weight of poor reviews, you are swamped, overwhelmed and concerned about profits being eaten into if you were to make proper, decent offers to your customers and have given up trying to even maintain a semblance of customer service. Yes, I expect there might be some conditions buried within delivery arrangements which absolve you of responsibility. Having read other reviews, my experience is not as huge compared to others. But, really? ""The Wonderful Every Day"" honestly? Am I so naïve to have expected so much more?

"Disgraceful . Called for a refund in-line with what’s advertised on their website. The representative was rude; very argumentative and interrupting. She went back & forth between me and a “higher-up”, who apparently refused to speak to me.

I sent her the URL with the policy printed (clear as day) I was quoting. In order, she and the “higher-up”;
1. tried to convince me I was on the wrong website;
2. told me I misunderstood the sentence;
3. told me to ignore that part and read a different part of the page, which was unrelated to both my order & my request, and finally;
4. told me to ignore the page entirely and instead read another.

She finally said she wasn’t going to escalate it further and nobody in the company would talk to me about it any more. Disgraceful.

IKEA is a massive company and I’m sure managing a big website is complex. But public information is a promise, and I made a purchase based on that info. The right thing to do would be accept the refund and to update the page.

I Tried to get in contact with IKEA all I get is a vague website with no online chat available, no email where to complain and they only send me to a number with no direct answers...

"Bad experience . my bad experience with Ikea started on 01,06,2022. I bought £2,550.50 at the store, to be delivered within 7 days. two wardrobes, a bed, a sofa bed, two rugs, two lamps. When order n 1285275694 arrived, the value described was £1,272.25, half of the order, When I returned to the store I was informed that the system stated that the order was all delivered and that half and the wardrobe that was in the wrong size would be exchanged. So I innocently bought another £1,498 on order n1287942571 the bed to bed settee and mudp servant which never arrived.
So began the saga to change their wardrobe and return £1,272.26.
today, 07/12, I still have my house full of boxes that I never put together for fear of the wrong order, they already promised to come and exchange three different days and they never came and I lost 1,272.26 because in the system it says that everything was delivered and it's not true , I live a nightmare.",Trustpilot_USA

I called costumer service. They told me that the rest of the delivery will be arranged for another day without any specifications. That meant that I should take anther off day to accommodate that. The lady in the phone got irritated. I suggested her to call the delivery for me. She said Ja, ja and just hung up. Poor service.

"Horrible customer service on buyback… . Horrible customer service on buyback items. Why is this service even there as its not serving its purpose. After estimation and talking to the customer service on phone, I took my coffee table in IKEA Dublin 11. The lady named Jemma came and without even looking properly said no as there are some marks.

"Price on shelf not always price you are charged at checkout. . Went to IKEA Exeter today. Wanted to buy curtains and found one clearly marked at £70 on the shelf. Got to checkout and they charged me £75, I had actually taken a photo of the product on the shelf with the £70 price, but was refused purchase of it at this price. So disappointed as I have spent lots of money at IKEA over the years and thought they were reputable and trustworthy. My advice is to check your receipts carefully!",Trustpilot_USA
"Horrible customer service . I have recently made a large order through IKEA in Norway. I did not receive several of the products that I ordered as the website does not accurately describe why the products are not actually available, so you do not know until you call customer service, why each item it not available and if you can even get it or not.

More importantly, the customer service is some of the worst I have ever experienced. I actually have saved a conversation with a customer service representative who left the conversation, mid conversation because I asked to speak to someone who could provide me with more help as she said my request was ""impossible"". I was simply requesting to change a delivery date to a later date. She refused to do anything to help me or explain why she could not move my delivery date further back. She told me she would send me an email and never did.

I next, talked with another representative on the phone who said he would help me with trying to change the shipping date of the order and would call me back later in the day. I received a very cold SMS later that day only stating my request was not possible with no way for me to send a message back.

I then got ahold of a 3rd representative who finally explained the issue to me, but again did nothing to help and by this point, my shipment had already been shipped. This was a couple days after making my order and I had been trying since day one to change the shipment. The representative told me that we could try to get the shipment shipped to somewhere nearby but there were no promises and I had to wait just before the items left the warehouse.

The problem is that we have not moved into the place yet and there is no way for us to receive the order at that location until mid July (over a week after the shipment will arrive). I am 6 months pregnant, taking care of a 2 year old alone and my husband works at sea. We now have to hire a car and helpers to receive the shipment and bring it to another location, only to have to hire people once again to bring the items to our new place when we move in, in mid July.

I would have canceled the order, but the problem there was that we are having to fully furnish the apartment and if we did not receive these items, I would have to be sleeping and eating on the floor until I found a new bed table etc... somewhere else.

I will never order form IKEA again and will continue to make sure others I know don't either.",Trustpilot_USA

"Is there any way to actually get my purchase delivered . I made an online order in IKEA UK on Sunday 26/6. I paid delivery for Thursday 30/6. Ever since 29/6 the IKEA online tracking has showed ""Order received - Packing your order - Getting ready to dispatch"" (still today on 8/7).
The delivery was not made so I called customer service on Tuesday 5/7. I was promised a new delivery on Thursday 7/7. According to the IKEA online tracking this delivery never even entered ""packing"" stage. Obviously no delivery was made.
I called the IKEA customer service again on Friday 8/7 (today). Somebody answered immediately (unexpected as previous time I had to wait over 10 minutes before anybody answered). The person mumbled very quietly, but I managed to tell what had happened and he took my order number. He put me on a hold. I waited for 18 minutes and then he hung up the call.

Update a week later (on 14/7). Yet another call to IKEA. Yet another wait. Yet another person. This one listened, was polite, acted, corrected the earlier mistakes, and rescheduled (again) the delivery. The delivery actually did come. Unlike IKEA claims, no prior text message or a call came, just the driver ringing the doorbell. However, I was home and received every item I had ordered. I am happy this ordeal is finally over, and increase my rating from one to three stars. However, it takes more trust building before I am happy with IKEA again.",Trustpilot_USA

First time I purchased from IKEA online. Terrible experience! . First time I purchased from IKEA online. Bought 3 duvets. Quality was awful. Return policy even worse. IKEA doesn’t provide free return labels so you have to pay to ship your items back. I paid $9.99 to have the items shipped to me and will also have to pay to ship back to the store. This policy isn’t clearly displayed when you purchase online and should be front and centre. And the process to return isn’t customer friendly. You have to call IKEA (wait in the que) then get a file number then call them back once you’ve shipped the package back to give them the tracking number. So disappointed!,Trustpilot_USA
"IKEA Kitchen - 6 months and still waiting... . I love IKEA and have bought loads from them over the years, so didn't think twice when ordering a kitchen from them. We ordered our kitchen in October 2021 and was told there were some stock issues but as we're not ordering anything crazily bespoke, it will more than likely be in by the time we get our kitchen installed.

Our kitchen was installed in January 2022, and we had several doors missing, a splash back measured incorrectly (despite us using their measurement service) and a dodgy bent tap. The fitters were great and did all the could but obviously couldn't complete the installation because not everything was present.

Roll on 6 months later, and after basically having rung IKEA every week since the installation, I now have all the doors, they have refunded us for the tap but I am yet to receive a splash back - which they measured incorrectly from the off!! They did send me an alternative splash back last week, but the difference in quality was a joke despite previously being reassured that it was like-for-like (just to put it in context, it was like comparing one sheet of paper to some thick cupboard in quality) it was just disappointing.

I'm bored and sick of having to call IKEA now every other day rather than weekly, as I just want to get it sorted. Some of the customer care team are helpful, some are just not interested. There is no communication, no reassurance at all. I appreciate stock issues are happening everywhere at the moment, but to be left in the dark with no update nor communication is just disappointing and disrespectful. As a customer (and having worked in customer service too), I am frustrated and annoyed it is still not resolved. My new kitchen experience has been totally ruined and thoroughly stressful.",Trustpilot_USA

"The worst customer service . I love IKEA, but my most recent experience ordering online has been horrible. I ordered a table for delivery and it was cancelled about a week before it was supposed to be delivered because it was out of stock. This table is almost always unavailable or out of stock, so when it was available, I jumped on the opportunity. I talked to customer service through their chat service and they were awful and so unprofessional--I've never experienced worse customer service. At the end of it all, they told me to order it again (it had become available online again), so I did. A week later, I got another message saying it was delayed by a week, fine. 3 days before my already a week delayed delivery date I got another message saying it's out of stock and I would be refunded. Talked to customer service and they told me to reorder it AGAIN and that it would be available this time! And that the reason it was cancelled was because my card was declined, even though it was already processed and posted weeks ago, AND I got a message saying it was because it was out of stock. So now I've waited about a month for this same table, been refunded twice already, and I don't have a dining table for an event I'm hosting next weekend. He kept trying to prematurely end the conversation by saying ""Is there anything else I can help you with?"" even though I clearly wasn't done...the last time he sent that message, then after literally 15 seconds of no response from me he disconnected the chat because of no response. This is probably the 5th person I've talked to via IKEA's customer service chat and they've all been so terrible. One of the people asked probably 10 times throughout the chat ""Well, how are you today?"" when I was clearly frustrated about my order, which is so frustrating it's almost comical. Mind you, this wasn't that long of a conversation and it was asked at random times.",Trustpilot_USA
"Be careful Ikea kitchen offers, because they are cheating on final price/offer! . We bought kitchen from you (without white goods). We talked with two different sellers at the time and we finalized the price for 22 468 dkk (in that price delivery is included) and we made an order.
At the end it looked like this;
You basically sold us a kitchen for 22 000 dkk indeed, but without cabinet fronts (front doors) on FEW of them, so the price for your offer wasnt real. Nice trick Ikea. Price of 22 000 for that kitchen wasnt real because we stayed without half of items (very relevant ones), and gave us unfinished kitchen for which we believed in that time when we were sitting there for two hours with your seller that he is selling us (like any other normal person would think) the WHOLE product for that price. Offer for 22 000, but actually for 25 000 (3000dkk more for buying afterwards the things which HAD to be included. Tell me. Who is buying such a mess? So we bought few fronts for cabinets, but decided to leave few of them without. Are you serious? Such a unfinished kitchen? It simply cannot be more clear than what it is that you tried (and you did unfortunatey) to do. Sell us a kitchen for 22 000, from your side fully aware that for that price we will not get what we HAD to have so that we can accept the offer as soon as possible so you are finished with us. You sold us a kitchen, because we fell for the trick of 22 000. Because if it were 25 000 we wouldnt accept it? Nicely done Ikea. Why did our drawing has every cabinet, has every front doors on those cabinets, why then that kitchen drawing looks so finished? Why we recieved and bought few fronts, but decided to leave few of them without? Widely open and “beautiful”? P.S. Very important. Ikea still sold and brought to me all the hingens for doors. You could do that ha?🙄 Terrible.
It is also sad that you are trying so hard to justify your doings, but every normal functioning person can understand and see what was your first intention, and can understand the game behind it.
Long story short, kitchen is beautiful, but definitely do not buy it at Ikea!",Trustpilot_USA

Me thinks another 6 months of run around. No they can't get the part from stock and they don't have size information on file.

However after sitting in returns I can tell you if have opened a box and no longer require and customer service advisor advises you can't return, just tell them you ordered the wrong colour the management will glue the box back together and reorder the correct colour, you then have an unopened box and a new receipt to return for full credit.

"Well here we are again . Well here we are again. I would love to update you and say Ikea have resolved my problem but far from a resolution its actually getting worse.

From saying they will swap my table via a too and fro of numerous emails with about 10 different customer service staff {herein lies the problem me thinks} I am now further rather than closer to any form of satisfaction.

The last operative tells me the table is out of stock and they dont know when its coming back in. THATS NOT NEWS. This was established a month ago.

So her suggestion, choose a new table and pay more if it costs more.

I chose my table and paid for matching chairs and now her frankly stupid suggestion to chose another is, I repeat, quite stupid, for two reasons.

1 Pretty much every other table they have is OUT OF STOCK that might in some way be considered even partially close to mine.

And

2 I chose that table and the matching chairs because they MATCH.

Its like going into a tailors and asking for a suit and choosing shall we say a rather nice tweed and then when you go to pick it up they say we have no tweed trousers but we do have corduroy.

Some how Ikea customer service are having a bit of difficulty grasping this obvious problem.

And to add insult to injury they made this suggestion of picking a different table 7 days ago and they have still not replied to my email in response to their suggestion.

I will keep you posted",Trustpilot_USA

"Return Policy Watch Out! Falsely advertised on website . Ikea lost yet another customer. We went there to return curtains that we washed once in cold water and hung to dry. They had shrink way more than the 4% shrinkage said on the package and did not fit our windows anymore. After having read the return policy on their website, we decided to return the curtains. At the return section, I was shamed for having washed the curtains and trying to return them. The lady that worked that there day was vile. I’ve never seen someone so angry at customers for no valid reason. We were shocked when she threw my stuff on the side and told me « Ugh, it smells like soap and you want us to take it back? » and went on to shame us and show attitude. We stayed polite and in shock and left. After that incident, I decided to chat with their customer service and I was told that the return policy is decided by each store and each person at the counter basically so they override the official policy. I’m never returning there and will file a customer protection complaint to the authorities. Their stuff is expensive and really really poor quality. Save yourself the time and money and choose any other home goods store around you.

"Unbelievably bad service from beginning to end . I just spent £1713 in-store on eight different storage cabinets on 10th June. The sales person writing up the order on the sales floor was not very knowledgeable about the products and had a ""could care less"" attitude. The Order Confirmation I received by email had 22 items listed; impossible for the untrained eye to make any sense of it or to identify the 8 pieces of furniture. After the check out I went to the ""TaskRabbit"" desk to book a ""specialist"" to come and assemble the 8 pieces the following week. They had no clue how to read the Order Confirmation and thus how to interpret my purchase and how to identify the 8 finished pieces in order to price the job. I gave up and made my own arrangements for the assembly.

I made it very clear that the delivery had to be made to a church which is open only from 11am to 4pm Mon to Fri. Surprise: the delivery van arrived at 9am and of course could not unload. I phoned customer service but was told they could not contact the driver!! ""It's all done electronically"" they told me. So much for 'personal' service.
In the end we got delivery the following day however one of the pieces (value £279) was badly damaged. I phoned customer service and was told that the piece could not be exchanged because there was no stock anywhere in the country to replace the damaged piece. We therefore agreed on a collection and full refund.
I then was told that the first available collection date is 16th July with a refund to be made 7-10 working days thereafter. This means they will have my money for 43 days before I see the refund of £279.

"Review on IKEA Nagasandra Bengaluru . Review on IKEA Nagasandra Bengaluru. The facility invited all members on 19th June, Sunday before official launch. We visited with excitement and discovered its a complete mismanaged and unlike professional staff in Hyderabad.
1. After we entered the escalator stopped suddenly with jerk and my 3 year old kid fall down with injury. The staff saw and said sorry for the inconvenience caused rather than addressing the electrical fault or flagging the same (although she was holding a walkietalkie). We shared the concern to address the electrical fix so that other people dnt face the same but she was not bothered. Luckily we were moving up, if the escalator would have been stopped whilst moving down it would have been a big accident.
2. We were invited on a particular time slot, but when we checked with other visitors it seems no one followed the time all dropped-in as per their time which created a chaos.
3. Went to the food counter and the supervisor responsible to manage the que was continiously busy on his cell phone and chatting with another staff. Once entered the kitchen staff were also slow in serving and wondering how to cater. Few went inside to bring plates and returned after 10 mins by the time there were a long que linedup.
4. Once we got the seat, looked for a microwave to warm the soup whic was been served almost cold, when asked the staff they replied the microwave is not working and to manage with the same soup.
5. When went to coffee m/c the machine went off and no one bothered to address and was directed to another machine. None of the staff responds politely and all were so busy interacting among them self as of its a first job they got.
6. While having food we discovered someone took away the trolley to keep back the plates, went to another staff and asked to share a trolley, and the staff responded in local language asking me to go and stand back into the que with anger.
7. Went to furniture section to customise the wardrobe, there were 3 staff on table and all struggling with computer. After 15 min of wait to understand one person asked us to come back after 15 more min as the actual counter operator went on break.
8. Improper sinages to exits. When checked with few security folks standing near fire exit as help showing the direction to exit, the security directed us to wrong direction showing entry inside. Finally few like minded other customer with family we came together and figured to exit outside.
9. There are no mobile network found inside so if you leave behind your family member you cant reach them over phone.

The complete setup and facility seemed messed up and unorganised with fresher non trained, non professional staffs. Only few overseas supervisor / management staff were roaming around and all were busy impressing them which was very clearly visible by all other customers as well.

Its a complete mismanagement and bitter experience. Hyderabad and Mumbai IKEA is very nicely managed with professional staff. Electrical safety is also a concern where we observed many open cables laid down.

"An amusing tale from a 3rd world country ikea store :) . As you can guess from the title I'm an extremely happy customer, who needs to share with you the unbelievable experience of buying a kitchen from your franchise in Bulgaria.
I've been Ikea's happy customer for over 10 years, so I endured patiently 30 days till the first available date at the store to order my dream kitchen. The big smile on my face disappeared when the kitchen department employee told me the kitchen design I created in your online tool (great app by the way) can't be ordered as the doors are discontinued, despite they appear on the site... So he made a new design for me but warned me I can order it only after I make another appointment after (you guessed it) 30 days :)
So 60 days into my life with 2 toddlers and no kitchen, I headed to the store with a sense of relief. Only to find out that the new design uses doors that are not currently available and nobody can tell me when they'll be available... But luckily (I thought so at the time) I asked about my previous design with the discontinued doors and a miracle happened - they somehow had them in store despite staff told me they were long gone and discontinued a month ago :) All with a bit of a catch dough - few other bits and pieces were missing, but i was assured this is quite temporary and i should have it all in no time. So I took all that was available and filled my living room with boxes.
So life goes on without a kitchen but with lots of boxes. My kids were quite thrilled by the situation. Turns out they are quite inventive and able to think out-of-the-box (and in- and around-the-box) :) Downside - found out my medical insurance is not so comprehensive as I thought...
2 months later I start getting nervous as my 60 days return guarantee runs out and I still don't have the kitchen I could return and get full refund for :) I start calling customer service asking for at least some probable delivery date - no luck.
Another 2 weeks and my phone beeps joyfully - customer service notification to go to the store and collect my order. Yupeeee!!! Going there, giving my order documents and almost kissing the lady at order collection. But she is not smiling - ""hm, there must be some kind of mistake, your order is not here, you got wrong notification... We still have no idea when we'll have it"". Dreams of home-cooked meals shuttered, plastic plate home deliveries continued (hey, I already know all the delivery guys in the neighbourhood by name)!
Another week goes by and another notification comes - half-tired, half-excited I go to the store. Guess what - my order is not there, it's wrong message! Seriously?!?
Few days and notification again. Hmm... Another message in 1 hour - ""don't come, we probably sent you wrong message""?!? Huh? I go online and check the items in the online store - they are now available there! They should have mine delivered if they sell them online now. I go there of course, can't stand the sight of my half-build, half-boxed kitchen anymore! The mistake is a mistake - my order is still in Neverland and the items in the online store are not really available, just says so on the site. I'm depressed and decide to do some shoppong therapy - hey, this is genius, you treat your clients like s*#t and maximizer your profits at the same time :)
After a nervous breakdown I decide to dismantle it all and bring it back to the store. But my conscience stops me - I'm a sustainability activist and can't scrap half-a-forest worth of material... Damn!
I decide to be reasonable - calling once a week to check status of order and carry on with pizza and Chinese. Until I got a call from customer service last week - ""Hello, you ordered something a while ago and collected it, but we never formally closed the order. I just call to see if all is OK."" NO, IT'S NOT OK!!! NOTHING IS OK!!! Lady on the phone is very sympathetic and promises she'll fix it all, I'll get most of the remaining bits in 6 days the latest and the rest - in 10.
Right. Should have known better. A week later, my phone is silent. I call again - ""we actually have 10 of those in the store, so you can come and collect your 4 items"". Excited? Relieved? Happy? Of course not - my order is not ready and they don't have the items in the store as customer service told me :p I NEED TO SPEAK TO A MANAGER, PLEASE! Frowning lady comes over, no ""Hello, I'm..."", no ""Terribly sorry for the inconvenience"", just ""We can't guarantee you a delivery, it's logistics you know. Other people are also waiting. Check in 3 days."" Right... Amazing customer service!
Shopping therapy doesn't help anymore, I need professional help. Turns out my medical insurance doesn't cover ""nervous breakdown after shopping in Ikea""... So I do what I can - going online and start writing to save some other poor souls from slow painfull kitchen dream death.

As the missing products haven't been on stock since the ordering time, we've been often in touch with Ikea's """"""customer service"""""" trying to get this issue fixed or at least an answer to all of this unexpected waiting time, but all we get told is that ""It's not IKEA's problem"" and that ""There is nothing that IKEA can do about this""... well, thanks Ikea.

Most of the items we wanted were not in stock and I understand there have been supply issues, however it wasn’t a good start. Once we were able to figure out a few options there were some items that could not be picked up but had to be delivered. Of course there is a delivery fee to have the pleasure of picking it up. The real in convenience is after you go through that entire store, make the mental gymnastics to figure out what you can actually buy, you have to wait another 45minutes - 1 hours for the employees to gather your order.

"Unreliable and order messed up . I ventured yesterday for the first time to IKEA´s new branch in Hammersmith, as it is local to me, where I ordered and paid for a white dining chair as a birthday treat to myself, to go with my office desk. I wanted it in Mustard Yellow, as it was on display at their store, but they said it was no longer in stock for delivery to their Hammersmith branch (in that case, I am not sure why they have it on display as some stores still appear to have it online and after all, Hammersmith is more of a collection store). But to get back to the point, I bought the Broringe white underframe and the Leifarne seat shell and was told to go the next day, which is today, first thing in the morning to collect it, as it would be delivered to their store overnight. I was there on the dot but when I went to the collection desk I was told that only the underframe had arrived and not the seat shell, but that I would be receiving a text later in the day and should then return to the branch to collect. Instead I got a call towards the close of business, only to be told there had been a mix-up and that it was not going to be available for pick-up ever at the Hammersmith Branch, so instead they had arranged to have it delivered as a favour to my home address on Tuesday 14th, without first checking to see if the day and time were suitable. It turns out I will not be around that day, I will be away on work, they should have checked with me first, I would have preferred that an effort had been made to have it delivered to their store, but that was not an option for them. So, I asked if I could go to the Hammersmith store for a refund, they said NO, as they had arranged to have it delivered and that I needed to call customer service for that. I rang customer service and asked them for a refund, after which I received an email from IKEA to confirm that my order was successfully cancelled and that I would receive a refund within 14 days, but as the order number in their email was different to that on my receipt, I had to call again to verify. This has been time consuming for me and not dealt with professionally by IKEA, they should have found a solution to compensate for their mix-up and have taken more of an interest. Generally, I do not feel they were remotely bothered, let alone concerned with customer satisfaction. So, my personal experience with IKEA's new branch at Hammersmith, is one of unreliability. I now have to wait for my refund, before ordering from another store and then I am not sure what I will be charged for the delivery of just one chair, when there is a branch so close to me. Moreover, I will not receive it in time for my birthday. Overall a disapointment, let's hope I do not have to chase up the refund.",Trustpilot_USA

DON'T BUY IT! It's a cool idea and it looks great, but the veneer is so soft it is impossible to avoid scratches and dents.

"Failed to deliver on booked date, no notification received, order arrived the next day minus 2 items that were damaged in transit!! . 57My large IKEA order was booked for delivery yesterday June 4th, to Cork in Ireland.
I waited at home for 12 hours, from the text advisory notice directions, from 7am until 7pm. Goods not received. No notification received or any communication whatsoever from IKEA.
I obviously rang Customer Services at 7pm, who advised me that all deliveries were delayed and all customers were informed. I most definitely was not, otherwise I would not have wasted a day of my life just waiting!!
As a goodwill gesture the CS agent offered me a voucher and was very professional and empathetic. Here I am still waiting for my ikea delivery, day 2.
Absolutely unacceptable that customers were not simply informed of the delivery delays, there is no excuse for this, a simple text would suffice!

UPDATE... my products arrived but two items were missing, which apparently had been damaged in transit from Dublin to Cork.
Delivery of these items is now Friday and I will not be informed of the delivery slot until the actual day, which means another wasted day and having to cancel important commitments. So my delivery from ikea has evolved into 3 days of my precious time spent waiting.

"Ikea Dollar Store . The product quality and customer service are abysmal, if you can find the product or something close to it any other place purchase it there.

The furniture is great if you are 4'5"" the sofas skim the ground with 4-5 inches of height, the pressed wood of the laminated products are thinner, less dense and the laminate is thinner and easily damaged, the metal tables have just enough strength to hold a bowl of fruit and enough space for bread plates, the material of the sofa covers is thinner and sewn sloppily.
Everywhere the could cut corners they have, it's become a really nice Dollar Store.
Customer service is anemic and slower than a 1 inch snail going down a deserted country road. The agents are curt, and repeatedly ask for a receipt after you've explained you lost it.

"Lousy, inflexible service Ikea Wednesdbury. . Just spent a small fortune over the last month or so on numerous visits to Ikea. Have just sat for over an hour on the M6 in traffic to get to Wednesbury Ikea, to obtain a refund or credit note on a few items and to buy more in store. Unfortunately, the receipts I had taken did not have one of the items I was returning on them it (my mistake, but they are almost indecipherable...) and the store refused to even give me a credit note, even though they could see I had been a good customer recently and spending healthy amounts in store. I was asked if I had an Ikea family card as they may be able to identify the purchase. I gave them my card and they said they could not see the item on the listed sales. I asked to speak to a manager and instead got a completely bored youth who flat out refused to give me a credit note, even given the fact I will have spent more in petrol getting to and from the store than the £12 it cost for the drawer organiser I was returning. I had to walk away with no return note, and I didn't bother shopping in the store I was so furious.
I set off on the long journey home, and when I got back I identified the various purchase from my bank account but as one of the purchases was in excess of £240 it wasn't clear how they could attribute the sale to a total amount. I rang customer services who was able to pull up the receipt on her computer and email me a copy. On the receipt was the item I had taken back for a refund, and, my Ikea family card number. So, the bored sales assistant and rubbish 'manager' had failed to spot it when they allegedly looked up my spending history today, wasting my time and money as this will now necessitate a return trip which will take another 2 hrs out of my precious weekend. What AWFUL service! I certainly will not be giving them my business again. People lose receipts sometimes or mistakenly bring along the wrong one.

"Yet another very bad experience with this company... . We last evening ordered x2 shelving units on line from IKEA Dublin.
The order was confirmed by email, but a second email arrived a few minutes later which said 'we are unable to process your order. Please contact your bank for more information.'
This despite the account being in good order.
Presuming a technical glitch we immediately phoned IKEA service hoping to sort the problem out.
They advised putting a repeat order through and sent a payment link. We paid a second time using the second card on the account only for the same to happen.
Checking afterwards (service was by then closed) we found that despite the cancellation of both orders our account had been debited for them. (x2 @ €150 = €300)
The account is still down this amount as of now. (the late afternoon of the following day)
We phoned service this morning to request assistance only to unacceptably be told that it was a matter between ourselves and the bank.
'Computer it say....'
The agent insisted that they had not received the money, and that it would likely be refunded by the bank within 24 - 48hrs.
The former may well be the case - and our bank could well have been at fault in the first instance but the fact is that we placed the orders with IKEA and our account was as a result debited for both payments.
They consequently had and have a clear responsibility to engage with the bank to ensure that the matter is promptly sorted out.
Also to with the bank resolve whatever systems glitch it was that permitted the debit to our account before the transactions were cleared. (if indeed it was a glitch - these systems seem always to be set up to benefit the businesses concerned)
It's a significant matter. Even presuming its rapid sorting out somebody took the use of our money.
What about the case of the person on a tight budget with e.g. standing orders to be met?
The icing on the cake came when she (the agent) dropped the phone on us while we were (firmly but politely) explaining that her refusal to help was unacceptable....
UPDATE x3 DAYS LATER. IKEA 'service' has since twice admitted that the problem was technical and on their side, and that it had been around for some days.
Why then if they knew this did the agent trigger a second debit of our account by advising that she put the order through a second time?
The bank meanwhile says that they can't refund without an instruction from IKEA quoting a code the bank gave us. IKEA say they don't do that, that it's automatic - and that it won't be sorted until their systems problem is resolved.
They meanwhile sent duplicate email stock order cancellation confirmations - this time suggesting that it could take up to 14 days for the refund to be processed. (?????)
The agent when tackled on the 14 days claimed that it was only a stock message, that it should be sorted in days.
What a mess...
UPDATE X4 DAYS Later. The €300 was back in the bank account this morning which is a relief given a previous experience where it took months to get a refund paid.
This doesn't detract from the reality of the uhelpful, ineffective and inappropriate handling of the matter by support - and the fact that the account should never have been debited in the first place....",Trustpilot_USA

"TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE CROYDON STORE . During a visit to the Croydon Store on 30 April 2022, after completing a purchase of over £700 accompanied by my sister, we took our paid for goods (some in trolleys and used two baskets) and went to sit by the area of collection for a chair we were waiting for. We had a lot of items and put some items in 2 baskets to help us move the items to the sitting area whilst we waited. A security guard came over and ""told us"" we had to take our items out of the baskets and that we could not take the shopping baskets out of the store. I advised him that was fine and that we were not leaving the store and would return the shopping baskets to the designated area (we had spent almost 5 hours instore finding our purchases and were extremely tired). I front of other shoppers sitting in the area, he stated no we could not and should do it right away. When we advised him again that we would take the baskets back before leaving he started to raise his voice saying ""no you must take your things out of the bag now and return them"" I reiterated that we were not in any way leaving the store as we had to wait for our chair to be brought out to us and were also awaiting a taxi we had ordered. This infuriated him and followed a barrage of arguing with us loudly in front of other shoppers. He then proceeded to leave and returned with another store employee who began to shout at us for not returning the baskets as we had been told. Again we reiterated that we were not intending to leave the store and would return the baskets. The store employee became verbally aggressive shouting at us loudly in front of the other customers which then led to us feeling really embarrassed at how were being treated, especially as were had spent several hours in the store and were extremely exhausted and the thought that the security guard and store employee were both treating us as if we had committed an offence. This caused us great distress on a day that had so far gone well and we were excited with our new purchases, this made what was supposed to be an enjoyable trip to IKEA one of our worst experiences. I have never had this type of treatment when I have visited IKEA before and am still appalled at our treatment. My sister who had accompanied me so I could buy my items was also horrified especially after I had been praising IKEA. This behaviour from staff should not be allowed or encouraged.

"I wish I could give zero stars . I wish I could give zero stars to their delivery service. I ordered from IKEA 3 times within 2 weeks. Because I work nights, I always choose their second delivery window (2pm-9pm). First time they called me at 12. I didn´t pick up, and they showed up at 12:30. I looked at his delivery instructions and it said 14-21. He didn´t care. The next one called me at 1 pm. I picked up thinking he wanted to confirm the appointment between 2 and 9. No! He said he´s 5 minutes from my place so he wanted to come right now. I was in the middle of a meeting, so I declined. I said I would only accept the delivery after 2 pm. The last one, today, came at 10:30!!! I had just gone to sleep a few hours earlier and had no idea what time it was. I asked him whether it was already 2 pm and he answered that he called half an hour ago (?!? why would he call me at 10 am, if my delivery is for 2pm at the earliest). I said that I booked the delivery between 2 and 9 pm and that this is not OK. He said (in German) ""Either you take this now, or I´m sending this back to where it came from."" Given no choice I said that since he already woke me up, he can also bring it upstairs now, but he took the delivery and walked away. His colleague was puzzled by this behaviour as well, but he just shrugged his shoulders and they left. Needles to say, I had to call IKEA service to learn that my delivery booked between 2 and 9 pm will not come today at all. This is HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE service. These people do as they please, abuse your phone number calling you at whatever time they want and deliver goods whenever they want. AVOID at all costs.

Nobody did! So I called again and they told me (at 5pm - the new couch was delivered at 10:30am) that it won’t be picked up today and that I should arrange a new date. So I did.

This second purchase has been a nightmare. I had paid for the measuring service to do a measure of my kitchen, they forwarded the measurements to Ikea and I made appt with kitchen planner. We planned new kitchen, I paid for it and it was delivered several weeks later.
The installer started to install it and discovered that none of the measurements were correct. The instore (Portland oregon) kitchen designer had put in the wrong numbers and we designed it around these incorrect numbers. There was no support from any Ikea staff after this happened. I went to the store and waited for an hour to sit down with another planner to plan a new kitchen. I paid for another kitchen (I had a house full of the wrong cabinets etc and had to hire a truck to take these back so i could get a refund). I did not trust Ikea to pick them up and give me the correct refund.
Installer came back...still missing pieces, cupboard doors, drawers for most of the cabinets etc and I had given them exact measurements for my farm house sink and they had sent wrong sink cabinet doors so there was no way the sink would fit.
I went back to Ikea with pictures of installers measurements as to what I still needed. Installer came back and when we opened up the new boxes, they were of the wrong style and wrong colour.

"IKEA double carbon footprint & double price policy! . Just ordered £500+ of furniture from ikea including 2 chairs which were showing as available for online delivery. On payment a message popped up saying only 1 chair available. Annoyed but went ahead with the order - delivery charge of £40. Checked online 2 mins after placing the order, and to my surprise, chairs again showing as available for delivery. So I phoned ikea asking for a 2nd chair to be added to my initial order. After being passed around, I was told stocks were low so it's a ""1 chair per order"" policy - but that I could indeed order a 2nd chair which would be delivered separately for an additional £40 delivery cost to me. I pointed out how crazy this would be as it would double the delivery footprint as well as doubling the cost of the chair (£45), but despite the customer service person talking to a supervisor, the advice remained the only way to obtain 2 chairs was to make a double order! To add insult to injury, as I felt disgusted by the whole discussion, I asked for the entire order to be cancelled, only to be told I'd have to wait 10 to 14 days to receive my money :-(",Trustpilot_USA
"Shocking! Avoid at all costs!! . So far Ikea has failed at the following;
- all items were in stock at time of order (I remember this because the things that were not in stock I removed from the order).
- they failed to deliver my order on the 5th March because Ikea had sold part of our order which had already been paid for.
- they then failed to contact us to let us know there was going to be no delivery.
- after all that hassle, the out of stock items were split from the order and the “in stock” items were set to be delivered on 8th March. I was told I had to call back to arrange the delivery of the out of stock items. (Great service!)
- 8th March I phoned Ikea after you failed to give me my 4 hour time slot. I was told “your 4 hour window is 09:30 until 13:30”
At 14:00 when guess what? Ikea failed to deliver again. I called again to be told…. I can’t help you can you call back in an hour???? (Really???) so at 15:00 I called back to be told “part of your order is out of stock (a different part) so it has not been picked to be delivered” so failed delivery and again no contact!
At this point I am losing the will to live so I request a refund and I point out that the order has been split, so that’s £749 in total which is £449 for current delivery and £300 for the out of stock doors.
- we get one email saying £449 is being refunded. I call back and ask for confirmation that the £300 is also getting refunded. That apparently can’t be done?? I tell them I am concerned that the £300 is not going to get refunded and I’m told it definitely will.
- guess what? £449 has been refunded and not the £300…. I call AGAIN On the 10th to explain my concern had happened and they haven’t done as they said. Im told it was stuck and has now been pushed through….. we are still waiting and it’s now 17th so I have very little confidence that Ikea have done this.
I have requested a managers contact information 5 times and been denied. Which is fair enough, however Ikea team members clearly are not “equipped to resolve my complaint” as it’s now 9 days later, it’s not resolved and Ikea still owe us £300.

After treating myself my new super king HOVAG firm mattress I was super happy and my sleep was instantly improved 😴

So it started failing after a few weeks (sagging becoming far softer than the rest of the mattress) I coped briefly by spinning it around, but this only works for a few days and a superking mattress isnt exactly light!

So my back is in agony each morning and only eases later on, only for it to go back into the bed that makes it agony again! even with exercises to help my back and pain relief its still painful 😡

I went to Facebook to get it sorted out and some fast customer service thinking its got a 10 year gaurantee! I am safe here!

So I sent lots of messages with 2 agents and detailed pictures showing the obvious sagging (with different angles and measurements) so that it was very clear to see

I was told twice the mattress isnt faulty and the 10 year gaurantee doesnt apply as its not faulty!...and I should get a mattress topper 😂

I was warned by another customer in the same position IKEA ask you for all the details then dismiss your issue no matter what! they were right!

So luckily I paid with Paypal and the faulty goods clause applies there, so I have opened up a full claim for a refund, I didnt want to do this but its only way forward

"IKEA customer service - Or lack thereof - Appallingly Bad . I have just wasted over half an hour with an IKEA customer service who provided an astonishingly low level of service and did so with an appallingly bad attitude.

I have a large item that I paid for delivery of, I assembled it over almost four hours and it developed a fault. The item is very large and very heavy, and I was told to return it to a store. It is too big and there isn't a store in the city where I live.

I was told it could not be collected and exchanged because the ""pandemic"" means that the service was suspended. The resumption of the service is at some unspecified date in the future. Absolutely no help at all.

IKEA are still delivering online orders so they can deliver a replacement, they simply choose not to. Blaming the pandemic at such a late stage is pathetic.

The agent tried to end the call several times and ended the call due to a lack of response as I was typing my response.

IKEA, you should be embarrassed by the way you treat your customers, we are not an interruption of your work, we are the purpose of it.

What appalled me most was that I was not asked what the nature of the fault was. I said I needed one part replacing and the agent said that that could not be done.

"Shockingly bad and ignorant delivery service . Shocking. I paid for delivery as larger bedroom and home office items wouldn’t fit in car. Comms were good with accurate text updates for scheduled delivery. But that’s as good as it got.

Youngish lead delivery chap was unsmiling. Other older chap was fine. I asked for help from the younger chap moving the large bedroom items upstairs. He told me he had to check the items delivered first and moaned about the difficult access and some items being heavy (which is why I asked for help upstairs!).

I returned to my home office upstairs as I’m working from home. After 10 mins and all being quiet I went downstairs to find they’d cleared off. No checking of items with me nor help moving larger bedroom items upstairs. Not even a ‘we’ve finished cheerio’.

I live on my own and there were two delivery chaps and it would have taken a few minutes to take the three larger units upstairs. But it was all too much trouble. And I paid for this!!

Contrast with an Ottoman bed delivery from a local company and it shows IKEA’s customer service, particularly delivery service, for what it is. More like IKANT (be bothered) .",Trustpilot_USA
"Ikea is playing with serious people . I have order a table on 08/02/22 and it was supposed to come on 23/02/22.
So I was here at my house when suddenly I received a message saying that my driver missed me out and he is going to come tomorrow.
That's absolutely ridiculous because I am inside and I was at the window and I didn't see anyone.
So I called ikea costumer services and I have been told that the company that run the delivery they can turn up whatever they want.
What a joke.

"Beware when purchasing flat pack units from IKEA !! . I visited the Croydon branch of IKEA to buy a chest of drawers. I chose the EKET range and purchased a 3-drawer unit in grey. Flat pack.
We built the unit according to the instructions, which certainly weren't as clear as some of the other instructions I have followed when constructing previous units. We persevered. It took hours.
Once built, we stood back to admire the finished product. Crooked, misaligned, wobbly.
We returned to IKEA to ask for guidance. We were told by one of the people who build the units that we could bring the unit back and if they couldn't fix it, we would get a full refund.
We brought the unit back to 'Customer Service'. Unfortunately, the customer service department were not too understanding.
Straight away they informed us that they would NOT refund us as the unit was already built. They said they would try and realign it for us.
We returned after an hour to find the unit sitting in the customer service area. Less misaligned but still ... misaligned.
I pointed out that the unit wasn't fit for purpose as it was so crooked. I was told that I need to take it home and 'keep adjusting it until it lined up'. I pointed out that I had already spent hours trying to do just that.
They stood firm and said there was nothing more they could do - they were NOT providing any refund.
They offered a service whereby I could have someone come and realign it at my home - at an additional cost. This came with no guarantee that this was even achievable.
What I want to know is why doesn't IKEA clearly give a WARNING on the front page of all instructions that once assembled, the item CANNOT be returned, even if it is malfunctioning. I was under the impression that the law in the UK was that you are entitled to a refund if something is not working / broken...
I had to walk away with the malfunctioning unit.
I was shocked at their coldness and determination not to even consider a refund or good will gesture of any kind. I know they are following orders and just doing their job - taking their orders from above.
Those in charge at IKEA - please note - your so called customer service is appalling.",Trustpilot_USA

All cabinets, doors and accessories were ordered on December 3, 2021. Most of the items were delivered with the following 2 weeks. Unfortunately, 5 cabinet frames were out of stock. I understand there is a global supply issue right now, bit it's very frustrating when you call Ikea customer service time and time again and they can provide NO information at all regarding the availability of the out of stock items. This is 2022. I cannot believe that a worldwide company like Ikea does not have a better production and inventory management system. So after 11 weeks, everything was returned to Ikea. This whole dreadful experience has cost ne a couple of hundred dollars from the initial shipping charges to renting a truck to return everything. If you do order a kitchen from Ikea, before committing, make sure all the required cabinets are in stock at that time. Otherwise, look elsewhere.",Trustpilot_USA

"Store card $uckery . I have an IKEA store credit card. I go to pay my bill on the due date, and there is a giant banner, stating they now have a 4pm deadline.... starting 2 weeks ago.

Could you imagine playing a board game with the likes of these people? Rule change! I called and was able to have the late fee removed ""as a courtesy"", but that won't help the interest rate, which is clearly the intent. An ethical company would have given it's customers a 60 day notice for the 4pm deadline, so customers would see the change coming when they pay their bill the proceeding month. The fact that they didn't tells you the late fees and higher interest rates certainly are not an unintended consequence. They knew exactly what would happen. Ain't they slick.

"My experience with IKEA has been a sham… . My experience with IKEA has been a sham from the start unfortunately.
I have asked for my case to be escalated multiple times, only to find that you do not offer any kind of genuine customer journey. Instead you provide road blocks. As such I have now begun proceedings for small claims court and reported ikea to trading standards and the ombudsman which I’m currently waiting for an outcome.
My journey started online with the Pax system designer only to find that your layouts default the size without warning and increased the car is size of the wardrobes to “239” which would not fit. You proceeded to deliver the wrong size and refused to cancel the second delivery even after I informed you of the problem.
Unfortunately this was the beginning of my problems and though very courteous and I would like to stress very friendly and diligent, your customer service is horrifically under trained, disjointed and hopeless. They have no concept of how to resolve a complaint nor do they seem to understand your own systems with any competency. They arranged for a collection to take place (this was on the Sunday 30th) on the Friday from the Manchester store while they dropped off 2 new wardrobe carcasses from the same store as it wasn’t available from distribution.
A delivery of more incorrect wardrobes took place on the Wednesday that you couldn’t cancel (not dispatched so how you can’t cancel baffles me). On the Thursday you delivered the first section of replacement wardrobes (I now had 8 wardrobes and 7 does plus internal scattered upstairs making it very difficult for us to move around and my pregnant partner had to climb over boxes). When delivered we realised you had now delivered the wrong depth of the wardrobe making the internals you had delivered useless not to mention still not what we ordered / wanted.
Friday came and you had cancelled the delivery dues to stock but your CS staff told us the collection would continue (if did not as it was cancelled)
When the weekend rolls round another complaint raised as I need the wardrobes out of my house and I have now discovered that most of what we had been sold online was actually discontinued back in October 2021. Baring in mind we have placed our order in late January 2022 I’m shocked this is a slick pant process. Past all the new complaints and subsequently finishing your CS to be polite yet in affective both in store and on the phone we have decided we can no longer try to find a resolution and make the wardrobes you deliver work (the second deeper set) we ask for all of the unit to be collected.
Your drivers come out onTuesday, to our bemusement it is booked on two aerate collection on the same day…?
This is where honestly I can’t forgive nor excuse the actions or issue with try stock, the first set of driver arrive around 11:30am they inform me heavily pregnant partner they will not collect the boxes from the top of our stairs (straight 13 steps to the front door, no turns and where you placed the units and had collected them from perviously) my partner asks what they expect her to do about it as she is pregnant to only be told it’s not their problem and she best figure it out and bring them down the stairs. So fortunate for ourselves we had carpet fitters in our house on the same day that intervened and brought the stock they were willing to take out of the house. Too the credit of your second set of drivers later in the day they could not of been more apologetic and couldn’t understand the previous drivers comments or what two collections had been booked but collected the ray of the items.
Though this has been a long journey already we aren’t finished yet, since the multiple calls as your staff don’t understand where £195 has gone between all the refunds, swap etc. we have still to receive a refund and though we once again have called tonight to try and resolve it so we can go into a store to try and sort wardrobes we are left without the fund that should of been returned to be able to do so. Only to top it off that this evening we were hung up and have received no email to update us in the situation after I sat on hold for 30 minutes, during my 18th call to yourselves totalling 13 hours in the last 2 weeks trying to fix your mess.

"Worst IKEA experience I’ve had . Ordered a daybed and mattress for delivery. 7am on a Sunday morning there was banging at the door with the delivery.

Rang customer services immediately. Very helpful lady, got onto delivery team and assured us they would call back before lunchtime after speaking with the van driver to see if they have the other parts. This NEVER happened.

Customer service agent specifically asked if we would like a morning or afternoon collection or our day of choosing. We specified afternoon. They came in the morning anyway!

"IKEA Appliance worthless 5 year guarantee . Bought an Ikea cooker with a 5-year guarantee. The cooker started turning itself off mid-cooking after a couple of years but we have a 5-year guarantee, they’ll fix or replace it and everything will be ok, right? WRONG!

Firstly, the guarantee covers fixing it and NOT replacing it. Hotpoint will keep fixing it until your guarantee period runs out and then you will be left with a dud cooker that you have to keep paying to repair. In the meantime you will spend hours at home waiting for them to fix it...again (see below)

Secondly, Hotpoint engineers are a nightmare to deal with. They don’t understand the cooker they are fixing. I was told the cooker was ‘just cooling itself down a bit’ when it was actually cool enough for me to put my hand on the inside of the oven. They order the wrong parts. One engineer didn’t turn up because he couldn’t find any parking and actually wrote that down as a reason for closing the repair case! They are an absolute joke!
The cooker was not even that good to begin with, even when it was working - it cooks more on one side and is not very powerful.

On the delivery day when they went to get my 17 items only 5 of them were available despite them knowing for 23 days they had to fulfil the order that I had paid for. That I had spent time saving for! And the only answer they have for this is they can re-order them and I’ll have to take another day off work and sit in the house waiting for another delivery in a weeks time, and the girl at customer services can’t even guarantee all the items will still be sent. Ive been told they might not be all in stock again on that date, so they will send what they have and I will have to call them again and re-order them again. I am speechless, how long is this going to go for. It’s not like it’s easy to get through to them as-well. Honestly pathetic. Don’t take a chance and give them your money, pick up in store if you need to. Looks like they take your money and hope you forget about it.

"Worst customer service ever...arrogance is a small word . All of the below relates to orders for my new summerhouse.

First IKEA did not deliver a part of my new kitchen. Secondly they can not find the missing part of my kitchen delivery. 5 plus phone calls to their customer service - no luck!

Finally my kitchen is delivered, but the delivery crew handles the goods very roughly and the kitchen plate and sink is missing.

The kitchen plate (which is 3,5mtr long) is then delivered wrongly at my home address and not the summerhouse.

In addition I ordered 4 new beds. The delivery of these beds is a disgrace. The delivery crew did not call in advance. So they choose to dump 4 new beds like tilted dominos in my winter garden...! This the packaging obviously can not handled because it was just thrown off the back of the delivery van.

I drove for 40 minutes (each way) and paid a $16 dollar toll (each way) to arrive at IKEA at 8:30; well within the window they provided. When I got to the door it was locked and there was a sign on the door saying that they have ""Winter Hours"" and they close at 8pm during the winter.

6. I called customer service at the store, after numerous calls we finally had a live person on the phone who confirmed that an online purchase can not be done. He also added that he cannot take the order on the phone or hold it last one in stock until the next day.

"IKEA kitchen disaster . I bought an IKEA kitchen, and sadly have had a terrible experience. In store service was fine, (although they should take more care when placing an order as there were extras in that we had asked to be removed) but the delivery / customer services were appalling.

My booking was taken no problem but then the distribution team emailed saying parts were missing so they couldn't process it. For a few days after however I had the sales team calling telling me to pay for it. The third sales guy that called told me everything was now available and I should pay to reserve it so I did.

You don't get contacted you just get emails with delivery dates booked sent to you, they don't check you can make the date or explain why you have several you just receive emails saying it's booked for delivery with no communication of install. There is no direct number to this team you have to email them but they never respond and if you call customer service they don't know what is happening. We received 2 delivery dates, one of which I am not in the country for so I rang the kitchen customer service team and asked then to change it. Instead she cancelled the whole order without asking at which point we lost our hold on the kitchen but did not know. They couldn't accommodate a simple date swap so in the end we had it rebooked for the same dates again. The installation guy was not notified instead he was texting me the customer for updates on our order due to lack of communication from IKEA.

On the 23rd of December just before Xmas and 2 weeks before the majority of our kitchen was set to arrive we received an automated email saying our order had been cancelled and refunded. No forward warning no explanation. I called customer services who informed me they were missing some of our doors! So they have refunded us because they didn't have them but still intended on delivering the rest of the kitchen with no update on stock availability. When I asked what would happen the response I got was you have to keep an eye out for them coming back on the website!! The customer has to actively look out for kitchen doors to match the kitchen ordered bearing in mind I hadn't received any info on what doors had actually been refunded either. Alternatively I could go in store and pick other doors. So now I am having a black kitchen delivered with 3 missing doors and I can pick some green ones instead, perfect!

We went into store to complain who when looking at the account explained that the customer service lady who cancelled the order had in effect lost our doors. They were not surprised in fact they were used to it so this terrible delivery and customer service team that IKEA have is very much a known thing yet they do nothing about it. Our whole kitchen had to be cancelled 2 weeks before arrival and we spent Xmas searching for a new one and someone to install.

We are still waiting on part of our refund 3 weeks later. We have had all the electrics and pipes changed to the IKEA spec as requested by the installation guy and now have to have it redone for the new kitchen, an expense IKEA was meant to pick up but heard nothing yet.

"The WORST CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE EVER! . The WORST CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE EVER!

I ordered a bed and paid full price for the bed as one unit, alongside a mattress and wardrobe to match in November 2021 and agreed the delivery date of the 4 December which I then made arrangements for the items to be assembled that day.

Within a couple of days IKEA advised they could not get the SLATS, they were discontinued never to be supplied and was crediting £30 to our account and sending the remaining items - Oh hello, you can’t have a bed with no slats for the mattress to sit on!! What a shower of foolishness. In between this they wanted to send bits of the delivery, eg draws for the bed, then the remaining items on differing dates. Obviously the order was cancelled and I was advised they would re credit the account within a couple of days.

Since then, I have been lied to, kept on hold , told 3 times the money would arrive into my account and then asked two times during the Xmas period to call them, even though I’ve sent several emails made calls and requested Customer Services complaints to resolve this alongside furnishing them with my contact telephone details on every email which they already hold on my file.

Today (5 January) I’m told for a fourth time after I have been asked again to ring them, I was sat on hold for 15mins (again), and asked to confirm my address and delivery address again for them to say they are transferring the refund now told and it would take a couple of days (3-5 days advised from a followup email from them). I asked the payment processor to speak to the customer services manager and was put back in the hold que to speak to them, which I have not got half hour spare to do!

So to this day, no formal apology, no investigation into any of my complaints, no followup and still no cash. They are happy to cause hardship as they knew I had to buy these items from elsewhere.

I need IKEA to experience my IKEA journey and for them to understand why I will NEVER SHOP WITH THEM AGAIN!

La COCINA nunca la terminaron, la dejaron hecha un desastre, el refrigerador me lo entregaron todo rayado y golpeado. Aún con todas las quejas puestas con ellos y las reclamaciones con la comunidad de Cataluña, España, no hicieron nada por reparar la cocina ni cambiarme una pieza de la cama que está dañada y es de fábrica.
EVITEN hasta donde puedan IKEA a menos que no les importe perder su dinero y su tiempo. PESIMO SERVICIO al CLIENTE.

IKEA is a terrible company when it comes to customer service. In my case, I put all the furniture on the floor and also made the kitchen with them. The KITCHEN was never finished, they left it a mess, the refrigerator was delivered to me all scratched and smashed. Even with all the complaints filed with them and the claims with the community of Catalonia, Spain, they did nothing to repair the kitchen or change a piece of the bed that is damaged and is from the factory.

"Among the worst customer service I have… . Among the worst customer service I have EVER received…and this was multiple agents!! Agents do not seem to be able to think for themselves and want us to do all the look up work for item numbers, as well as repeat everything we just spent a lot of time typing in, although the orders are at their fingertips. Agent had to get manager to do a simple online return. After waiting 30 minutes, agent said we cannot do returns for online items. What???? After getting upset, they said they’d refund me and then I was disconnected and had to *start over* and wait all over again!!!

Apparently there is no return policy in place for online orders and we are either stuck with defective and/or broken items, or have to drive down to Ikea in person, even if there’s not one nearby.

To top it off, they are out of 75% of the items I put in my cart, and don’t tell you until you’ve already put in all of your information. Just pray you never have an issue with your order!!!",Trustpilot_USA

Imagine our surprise when we opened the boxes to discover IKEA had sent WHITE legs (the legs are also the wrong size) and WHITE drawers to go with our brown bed! I contacted them by chat as my French is still not great and the only option I was given, was to drive 90km to my nearest IKEA store with four huge boxes of bed parts to exchange it. Hang on a minute I said, this is your error, why should we drive nearly 200km and hire a van, to sort out your mistake? Read our returns policy they said! I have been shopping with IKEA for a long time both in the UK and now in France, and have to say this is absolutely shocking behaviour. You can't take money from people, send the wrong stuff and then roll your eyes and say read our returns policy.

On 21st of October I stepped inside your store from Baneasa, Bucharest, Romania. I ordered at that time a bedroom. Or at least this is what I thought. The lady forgot to add a closet I am sure I mentioned, so when they delivered it, I figured out it was missing. 2 guys came during the next following days and they were able to assemble only the desk because the bed it turned to be broken and the closet, as I said, was missing. They gave me a changing paper, I sent the pictures to Ikea but they told me the bed was not in stock anymore so I have to wait. I waited because I really wanted that bed regarding the fact that the headboard was already assembled in my room. After a week they told me they still do not have it in stock and they asked me if I want to keep it broken or I want to keep waiting, so I kept it for a discount and rescheduled the assembling. In the meaning time I had to make some phone calls to schedule the assembling of the closet because for some reasons it seems like as long as I have an assembling team in my house already, they cannot do 2 pieces of furniture that are there. (so stupid policy by the way, YOU LOSE TOO THIS WAY. Time, gas, and you annoy customers a lot, for me that meant 2 days off instead of one for example). And because my life is not spinning around Ikea I took a day off and I waited for them. All the way to 8PM when they called to tell me they cannot make it that day but the next day I will be the first customer they serve. Anyway. The next day they came and surprise! They told me they do not assemble a broken bed and they left and I kept sleeping on the couch. (Despite Ikea had the pictures of the deffect and they knew the bed is broken, nobody told me they wont assemble it). They gave me another changing paper. After I tried to solve this through phone calls and online chat, and everyone told me there is nothing to do about it as long as I accepted the discount, I went to the store where they told me I have to wait until the bed is available again. Suprise! Now my problem can be solved. (Yes, I am saying that your call center and online chat is as useful as ”g” in lasagna).
So this is how, dear reader, I waited a month and a half until the bed was available again. A whole month and a half of sleeping on the couch while having a payed bed. When it was finally available, I went to the store, I returned the discount and ordered it but guess what? I had to pick it up myself. At that exact moment because... God knows why! That lady just told me it is the right thing to do these days. And this is how me, myself and I (a 55 kg girl stuffed in 165 cm) with a small car left Ikea with a whole bed. And yes, I went all the way to the third floor too with it. AND I HAVE DONE IT WITHOUT BREAKING IT. When I arrived home, I had to call a team to pick up the broken one and I had to schedule another assembly team because, for some reasons, the lady from the store could not do it this time. First time it was possible... now no. (And btw probably you know what a phone call to Ikea means in December, yes... I waited 30 minutes every time until someone talked to me). They scheduled the assembly team again. After a week. Another day off. And exactly! They called again at 8 PM to tell me they wont arrive that day but the next day I will be the first customer. I was the first one indeed and guess what he told me? The guy who came to assemble my bed? ”You had a mattress, why didnt you sleep on it”?
If I knew I have to face all this journey to be able to sleep as a normal human being, I would have chosen Dedeman in the first place. Today is 17th of December and I am going to sleep on a bed I payed 2 months ago for the first time. Who is going to pay for my days off taken for no reason and for my nights I slept on the couch? I am not a Karen and my patience has a mountain size, but Ikea you messed up every single step of my order. This was the first but definitelly the last time I interacted with this store. And I will make sure the ones around me know my journey in detail before buying your products. If you made it this far, thank you and I feel sorry you have to work in such place.

"I had a very bad experience with the…delivery . I had a very bad experience with the third-party company that Ikea used for the delivery. This company was supposed to deliver to my front door. I will admit it is challenging to find parking but we contacted them to notify them there would be a challenge. My son offered to meet them. Unfortunately, I was sick in bed. They parked about 100 meters from the back of my building on another block. They asked my 17-year-old to help them carry one of the Alex drawers that we ordered. They left him with a Karlby Countertop, two Alex Drawers. to carry about 30 stairs by himself. He is probably 120 lbs soaking wet, the Karbly countertop weighs 88lbs give or take. I had no idea this was happening as I was sick in bed, my son came back struggling out of breath and sweating. He looked like he was going to pass out. He said I almost fell down the stairs 4 times. He also managed to drag one of the Alex drawers up the stairs. This was a birthday present for his 18th birthday and he could have been badly injured. I have been in retail for over 28 years and this is absolutely unacceptable. They use a 3rd party delivery company called 24 hour Metro. All I was offered was a refund on my delivery charge and a $25 dollar gift card as an apology. I contacted the call center and was not allowed to talk to any manager. I know this is BS because I was a manager of a call center, there has to be someone in the escalation team. Come on Ikea you can do better than that? My son could have been very badly injured? Broken a leg, injured his back, or lying under the countertop. Do you need pictures to see how steep the stair are? To understand the gravity of the lack of customer service your 3rd party delivery did today. The refund on the delivery fee and the gift card as an apology does not cut it for me.

I tried contacting Ikea various times to get this issue resolved, I recieved a reply via Facebook messenger but after I replied, silence. I left a comment on Ikea's facebook page and recieved a reply, but only after I left a comment which is very funny, is it not?

The items were in brand new condition the returns manager made every excuse on the planet not to refund .
The sellotape was not Ikeas sealing the box he said
Absolutely Rubbish , I opened the boxes in front of the manager to show the contents was untouched
IKEA still made excuses I wasted 3hours
I asked them to re-seal the boxes so I could leave it took 3 members of staff to reseal the box so how the hell was this opened prior to returning.

"""You don't have to shop here"" is the store mgr's approach to taking care of customers and families . My husband, my two toddlers and myself went to Ikea tonight. Not busy at all and tons of workers standing around. We were at check out and they told us we couldn't buy 2 storage bins because we didn't have the lids. 1) we didn't know they came with lids 2) we didn't want them. Not only would they NOT allow us to buy them but 2 mgrs, Billy and Sarah, and loss prevention came to us and told us that we would have to go get them. Now we were tired, Ikea is a HUGE store, and they never once asked if they could quickly go get them for us. No lines at check out. 4 people telling us we couldn't buy something. Sooo we had to put everything back in our cart, go back through the store, find the lids and we were so upset. The little tiny sign that says we should get both parts was covered by one of the other advertised containers. When we finally got back up to check out, I went back to the mgr Sarah and said that I was so disappointed with their customer service approach which was, ""you either want it or you don't"" and ""that is our policy"" which were both solutions to our problems apparently, and she could only muster the effort to say ""Have a nice day"". My kids are hungry, mommy is so crushed. 4 people standing around could have saved our day and made our Thanksgiving one of gratitude. But instead I am writing this review hoping that America changes the way they ""take our money"". I will be reaching out to Keith, who I was told was the store mgr and for Billy?....You are a mature man who I hope would understand that having a family walk all the way back through the store for a lid when you have workers standing around is a straight up ""I don't really care"" attitude and it shows.

"Terrible delivery service. . After buying a whole kitchen at Ikea the experience of getting the stuff delivered was absolutely terrifying.
My kitchen supposed to arrive in 6 different batches, the first 3 to be delivered in the same day.
After my first delivery I feel like I make a capital mistake trusting the delivery of my kitchen to Ikea services.
The delivery is not actually done by Ikea but in my case by CDS. The guys who came to deliver told me they had to deliver 82 boxes but in fact I received only 69. The delivery guys would lie to me, not show me any invoice or confirm the number of boxes, but instead pass me to their boss and disappear. The CDS customer support was extremely aggressive and threatening and eventually all they said was that they are not responsible of anything. I was left after speaking with the Ikea customer support to check myself all 69 boxes and see what is missing.
And this is only the beginning, still have 2 more deliveries to come and two other orders to eventually arrive in stores someplace, sometime.
I could not believe that Ikea would contract such unprofessional and threatening companies such as CDS.

We finalized the plan. I spent $8200.00 on my cabinets including parts, I paid extra to have all items delivered to my home. My shipment was to be delivered on November 17th, 2021. Of course it didn't arrive until the 18th. Once all items we inventoried many items were missing cabinets, doors, parts, and lighting. Several cabinets were damaged as well. Trying to reach someone that gives a damn is impossible, long wait times, disconnected calls, no return calls or emails. Now they are telling me that I have to pick up some items in Kansas, I live 3 hours from Ikea and other items will be shipped to the store and they will ship them FedEx to my home. This just keeps costing me money with the delays and the labor. Ikea offered me a 10% credit. No thanks to their offer.

Having spent literally hours both on the phone and on ( the completely soul destroying!) 'Chat', this utterly time wasting experience has been one of 'the' most frustrating shopping debacles I have ever encountered. From an hours long wait to speak to a customer service representative, to the joy of dealing with the passive aggressive, rude attitude of the 'Chat' staff who obviously believe that it is their moral duty to remind us that we are living in 'unprecedented times' ....hence why IKEA's Customer Service can now be rubbish and, we the paying customers, should obviously be far more understanding of their failings and lack of training. Telling customers they are wrong ( over & over again ) must also be part of 'Chat' training only for them to finally realise (30mins later) that actually ... the customer (me!) was in fact correct. No apology needed obviously. The thought of having to deal with Customer Service again fills me with complete dread ...however sadly I know this whole sorry saga is not over yet ...... My advice to all would be to perhaps steer clear of IKEA if you can, or at least until they can find a customer focused business model to help them navigate their way through these (in their words) .....

"ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING CUSTOMER SERVICE… . ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING CUSTOMER SERVICE AND TOTALLY ROGUE REFUND POLICY.
I ordered a sofa, together with the TaskRabbit assembly as I am 70 years old and could never manage to do it myself.
At first I was rather pleased that the sofa was to be delivered the day after I ordered it. I proceeded with booking the TaskRabbit which said they would match me with a tasker at least 24 hours before the job was to be done. I waited and nothing happened, so, I called TaskRabbit and apparently there was no TaskRabbit tasker in my area.
As the sofa was going to be delivered that day (yesterday) and was already on the way, I could not cancel the order. I then had to get in touch with IKEA . The website said they were not answering emails nor operating the chat line. I clicked on the “call us” option and got... nothing. I eventually found their phone number on a Google search. I was told to refuse delivery and call back the next day (today). Which I did. I was then told that I would have to wait 14 days for a refund. I explained that I certainly would understand the delay if I had simply changed my mind either because I didn’t like the colour or I had found another sofa somewhere else. This was not the case. I had to return it because the service IKEA got me to use and book to assemble the sofa does not have anyone in my area. There is no warning about this on the IKEA website. I asked to talk to a supervisor, waited and got to talk to the most unhelpful, abrupt to the point of being almost rude person. She just kept on repeating that this 14 days was their policy and that was that. I asked how to make a formal complaint and could not believe the answer. She told me to write a review on their website! WOW that is the strangest form of formal complaint I have ever come across. I then asked to talk to someone higher or to be given the email of whoever was in charge and she just blurted out the customer service email so fast that I had to ask her to repeat it, which seemed to annoy her and she told me that they were the only people I could email. Yeah sure i would then perhaps get her workmate to answer my email in a few weeks with the same answer. In the end she just kept on asking me, robot fashion and quite abruptly, if there was anything else she could help me with.
I am now stuck. 70 years old and through no fault of my own I cannot afford to order a sofa from somewhere else until I get a refund.
The impression I got from this conversation is that I was just a nuisance, she could not care less and tough but I'd just have to put up with it
Funny how they can process a payment in a day but it takes 14 days for a refund!

We should have had our kitchen counter top delivered at the of August, IKEA messed up on the measurements (yes, IKEA, not the contractor, because the contractor drawing was correct) and we notified them. They didn't hear and we had to get the contractor to come to our house again to tell us ""the measurement in the drawing are correct"" and once again IKEA made the mistake of understanding the drawing wrong and we had to tell them the order measurements wrong. We had the contractor saying to us to order it and if it happen to be wrong we would start this process again. For a company that says it is sustainable, this is the least sustainable thing you can do: order wrong measurements when we know for a fact that those are wrong and more material will be needed to do a second order. After 3 weeks, we finally fixed the miscommunication and the right order with measurements was made. This delayed the order.
This was only the beginning. Then, IKEA called us telling us that the back splash measurements were too short, all was fixed quickly but as a result the order was even more delayed.
But wait, there is (sadly) more: since then we had at least 2 more times the date of delivery postponed without a detailed explanation. The contractor showed at our door one day to install it and no countertop had been delivered, telling us ""IKEA didn't notify us the delivery date was postponed"".

And now here we are: we got an email 20 days ago postponing our order delivery date again (keep in mind we paid in advanced) and had been asking to be contacted via email and Facebook messenger and we have had no contact from IKEA yet. Facebook messenger tell us they moved my file to the right department and that I will be contacted, and nothing happens, no call, no email, nothing.

Today we got another email saying they expect us to contact the assembly partner to plan a date of instalation when they should be the ones doing it. And once again I am not getting any answer from IKEA Barendrecht, and IKEA customer service just tells me there is nothing they can do. What about delivering a service I already paid for 2 months ago?!

This is unacceptable, and all this could be avoided if IKEA just called us to discuss this topic.",Trustpilot_USA

Except when I asked for the delivery day to be moved to the next Monday, which they said was no problem, they instead shifted that to the next Monday a week after!

Rang up, gave the order number and they demanded every other piece of information. Got fed up and hung up, telling them if I'm not in when stuff arrives that is their problem not mine, as my patience with this nonsense is now exhausted.

"Never get installations services through IKEA . We bought an Ikea kitchen including assembly of Montera in January, it is now October and the kitchen is still not installed.

In the months since our purchase, IKEAs sub-contractor Montera has proven to be incapable of executing the what ought to be a simple commission. They do not arrive at appointments, they don’t know what parts they need, they do not respond on correspondence and they make short cuts that - if not detected-would have led to water damages. Just to give two of the most disheartening examples on Monteras capabilities. I myself have a past as an interior designer and in all my years working with various craftsmen and construction companies, I have never come across anything worse than Montera.

When the problems are to be sorted out, both Montera and IKEA refer to each other. What is particularly distressing is that Montera has divided the company into sub sections where e.g. electrical installations are carried out by Montera-electricity - i.e. their own subcontractor. This makes it even more difficult for the customer to possibly complain and claim responsibility.

To further add to examples of abandonment of responsibilities IKEA's customer service often has waiting times of one hour or more. Once you finally are put through customer service just replies that they unfortunately are not acquainted with the case and that they therefore cannot help or respond to anything. The message will all be the same: I'll take a closer look at this and I'll call you back. However, IKEA never calls back

- in that case we would have to pay ourselves for transport
- we wouldn’t get a compensation if the pieces are too damaged (everyone who forks for Ikea or who has PAX knows very well that it’s impossible to dismantle it without making further damage)

"Two experiences, both awful . Placed an order in 5/21 to be delivered across the country in July for my daughter's first apartment.

Of course, we are thousands of miles away. I guess they just decided to delivery a day early without confirming? We were lucky that my daughter's building management accepted the delivery for us.

After many calls to Ikea they finally delivered that two weeks later, without any sort of notification (the driver actually knocked on my daughter's door at 8am Sunday morning with the sofa unannounced).

Two months later, my son moved into his first apartment, also across the country. I was hesitant to order again from Ikea based on the first experience, but decided to try since many furniture manufacturers had long wait times due to Covid. Again, we scheduled the delivery based on my flight for his move in date so I could help him assemble. We got two calls the day before scheduled delivery, and two on the scheduled date saying all was good. We waited all day in anticipation of putting together over $2000 worth of furniture.

"JUST TERRIBLE . I really want to like this .com, especially since I love their brick and mortar stores, but they make it SO DARN HARD. I Spent over THREE HOURS waiting for a rep. That wait was for both phone and chat service only to be told the specific item I needed to cancel was just shipped.
It mattered not that it's their fault I couldn't get to their reps to inform them of the cancellation (I placed the order less then 24 hours prior so I was well within a reasonable window.) They simply wouldn't take ownership. The item was delivered and frankly the prospect of having to deal with their AWEFUL customer service is enough to make me keep it.
Furthermore, for a company that boasts about being eco-friendly, that conscienceness is not reflected in their packaging. My shipments always arrive in boxes nearly three times needed. The box size to content ratio is nothing short of absurd on a cartoonish level. One would think I purchased furniture but...um nope. I purchased stuff like serving bowls, small storage boxes and jars with lids.

IKEA reported that they checked with Select Express and reported it was on a truck on the way to my house. Select Express later called and reported they never received the order from IKEA.

Having enough of getting the run-around, I called customer service and cancelled the order, and they were nice and offered a $40 gift card for my troubles. They were friendly, too, so why was this a bad call? Because they NEVER CANCELLED THE ORDER and NEVER REFUNDED THE PURCHASE. I was receiving calls from the delivery company about scheduling delivery a few days later.

So I had to call again and wait again just to cancel the order again. The rep was friendly again, and I got emails this time confirming that the order was cancelled, and the refund would be administered within 2 weeks. I'll believe it when I see it.

That day came and went. Finally broke down and started calling CS and had smoke blown up my #%*^ about how FedEx probably hasn’t scanned the parcel, though on their website it states the parcel is still getting ready to ship. Finally after 6 calls, I requested a tracking number. FedEx states they have received the purchase order but not the package itself.

I call the resolutions department and FINALLY someone tells me the truth:
This shipping issue has been ongoing with IKEA and management is ignoring internal requests to address the issue!

Furthermore, the agent admitted that FedEx has a 3 week backlog on orders from IKEA! I find it hard to blame the carrier because I ordered pretty much everything I needed for my renovation product on the same day and the only item I HAVEN’T received is my parcel from IKEA…4 of the 11 orders have been delivered by FED-freaking-Ex, BUT none of those items were purchased from this useless store! They KNOW that any order will take weeks, not days, and they still send out bs delivery dates and useless tracking links! IKEA needs to shut down their online order branch, address their order fulfillment issues and start talking to the carriers about better delivery options. You know why shipping is so cheap in the US? Probably because they negotiated the lowest tier of delivery service with a single carrier! Why is the customer not given an option for how they want their packages shipped? USPS and UPS should be an option! I send my son a care package in KUWAIT 2 days before I made my IKEA order… he’s received his package! Really IKEA?

IKEA is raking in money hand over fist but don’t give half a damned about customer service! There is a store/maze 2.5 hours away and now I regret not taking a day trip to pick up my stuff!

"Disappointed, but not surprised. . If i could put 0 stars I would. I’ve ordered from Ikea a total of 3 times now. The first time i ordered from Ikea, i ordered the Full Size Malm Bed Frame with a couple of other things. Well, when the delivery day came, I was told by the delivery men that “it seems we forgot two packages at the warehouse, we’ll be back with it in a few hours. They never came back. The same day i called Ikea customer service & explain to them that i was missing the third package for my bed frame as well as a shelf i ordered. She was very polite, & explained to me that the shelf was out of stock so i’d be refunded for it and that there “wasn’t a 3rd package for the bed frame.” Well a few days later when i go to assemble it I’m missing the middle support beam & the slated bed bases. So the following morning i call Ikea and inform them of this. They gave me a $50 gift card & told me they’d have it to me as soon as possible. Well apparently there’s no rush shipping so it still took nearly 4 weeks; 4 weeks sleeping on the floor.
The second time i ordered from Ikea there were no issues, the missing items from my first order came at the same time my second order did.
The 3rd and final time i ordered from them was just recently. I ordered the Hovet Mirror, two shelves, & a chair. A few weeks prior from the delivery date i was sent an email that the chair was out of stock and that i’d be refunded for it. The delivery date was set for September 1st. I live in Louisiana, a massive hurricane just hit us so i expected there to be a delay in my items being delivered which i was completely fine with. I got an email September 3rd saying that i’d be refunded my entire purchase because all of the items i ordered were “out of stock.” I was livid. As soon as i read the email i called Ikea and explained to them why i was frustrated since i waited 3 weeks for my items to be delivered & two days after they were supposed to be delivered i got an email saying i’d be refunded. The man i spoke to was very nice & explained why he didn’t understand that i received that email considering everything was in stock. He told me that i could replace my order using a link he sent to my email. They still had my money so i didn’t understand why they couldn’t use the money they already took from my account to put forth on this new order that wouldn’t come till the end of September.
I didn’t place the order because i’m convinced Ikea is a scam. I wasn’t given a valid reason as to why my order was cancelled at the very last second, nor was i ever apologized to. When you see others ordering from this company with no issues you wonder “why me?”",Trustpilot_USA
"Terrible service. . After 3 weeks of waiting for the estimated delivery date, which is already a huge timeframe compared to almost every other store (even more so when paying such a huge delivery fee), and having no update, it was clear that our order wasn't going to arrive.

I got in touch with Ikea only to find they don't have two of the items in stock. They're only minor items compared to the other stuff, so we're happy to remove and refund them. What we're not happy with is waiting 3 weeks for the delivery date, with absolutely no word from Ikea, to find that this could have been sorted much sooner if they had actually bothered to inform us of the stock issues. I dread to think how much longer we'd have been left waiting if I hadn't gotten in touch with them.

At my request, they removed the two out of stock items and rescheduled the delivery, split over 3 different days. What they neglected to mention was that they had removed 2 additional items from the order.

Quite frankly terrible service. I certainly won't be ordering from them again.",Trustpilot_USA

"Terrible communication and service . I was expecting a truck delivery from ikea today. The window being 7am to 7pm and as nothing had arrived nor did I receive any email, text or notification, I called to enquire where the delivery was. Only to be told that it got missed in pick up and therefore isn't on its way to me today. I was understanding and asked if it can be prioritised to be delivered tomorrow. I was told that the drivers only come out to the area once a week and therefore I have to wait another week for my order. For starters, the error was made, fair enough but nothing has been done to assure the customer that they are doing what they can to try and rectify the problem, instead I am being told I need to wait. Secondly, a whole week away? Surely with the amount charged for delivery fees, ikea can organise for a special delivery seeing as though the error was on their end. To make matters worse when asking if there is a way I can be notified on the delivery next week, I was told there is no way for me to be notified unless I call (and the wait time to speak to someone isn't a short one) and enquire on the day. The lack of communication and service is pathetic. I am a long time ikea shopper and am waiting on two orders. I assure you, these will be the last orders I will ever place for myself, my family and my friends.",Trustpilot_USA
"I don’t even know where to start but… . I don’t even know where to start but this singlehandedly had to be the worst and most frustrating customer experience I have encountered during the pandemic.

I wanted to get a shelf for my basement and a monitor stand for my desktop. Since we are still in a pandemic, I was hoping to be able to just pick online and have it delivered but already encountered the first issue there:

1. Online shopping unfriendly inventory management: Depending on what you are trying to order you may be eligible for online delivery or not. In my case the items I picked were only available for physical pickup at a store further away then 2 other Ikea stores. For those not wanting to go into the store physically (still in a pandemic) this led to the next problem:

2. Fee for curbside or locker pickup: I understand having to pay for delivery to my home (which again wasn’t even an option) but having to pay for driving down to a store further away seems weird in this day and age. I decided to opt for the “Locker pickup” option which led to again another problem:

3. Poor to no instructions for locker pickup: Once the order was ready for pickup I received a code to be used at the locker but no further instructions. No instructions can be found on the website either as to where to find those ominous lockers. No problem I though, I will figure it out once there. Guess what, next problem:

4. No instructions or signage for locker pickup on site: Arriving at the Vaughn location in Toronto there is signage to follow to the regular entrance and then there is signage to lead you to “click and collect” at the lower level of the parkade which I now know is the equivalent to curbside pickup (Keep in mind that Ikea locations and their associated parking lots are typically rather large layouts with multilevel parking). The email confirmation for the locker pickup confusingly uses the terminology “click and collect” as well so surely this would be the right way to go. After arriving at the spot and sending a text with my order number I am told after waiting for 15 minutes that I have to pickup my order upstairs at the lockers. Driving back out the parkade and upstairs in front of the store, lockers are nowhere to be seen. I get out of the car ask an employee. They tell me to go inside (Great, still pandemic). I go inside, can’t find anything, ask another employee who tells me they are outside on the other end of the building at the exit. Go figure. Finally, having located the lockers (again no signage there whatsoever even after I knew where to find them) I picked up my order and drove home, just to discover, you guessed it another problem:

5. Misleading product description: Turns out that what I thought where floating shelves are just boards for a shelf, requiring additional brackets to be bough. Upon closer inspection that piece of information is buried in the hidden fine print of the product description. Armed with this knowledge I now am interested in buying a proper floating shelf and returning the two useless boards that are called a shelf. At this point I am very curious about what the next problem may be:

6. Difficult return process: Unlike with other online shopping experience return information for a particular order are hard to find. They are not in the order confirmation email nor in the order summary of the website. You find them separately on the website and then manually add in your specific order information. At this point it would be boring if there weren’t further problems:

7. Returns in person only: Did I mention that we are in a pandemic? Having filled out my online return form it tells me that now I am good to return it in person at any physical store. Excellent, tried to do that today, drove to a closer store this time (Still 40 minutes drive) only to discover the final problem:

8. Returns require appointments or very long wait times: If you didn’t have an appointment for a return the wait time, I am told by an employee is 2 hours. How do you get an appointment you ask? Easy just another form, somewhere on the website, the employee couldn’t really tell me where. 2 forms not easily found to accomplish 1 simple thing.

At this point I am beyond frustrated. What I bought isn’t even worth the gas and depreciation of driving to Ikea twice, nor are 2 hours of my live worth it. I secretly hope that somebody in HQ will have a bad tasting meatball for lunch....",Trustpilot_USA
"The worst customer service and delivery . Ikeas products are great but their delivery and customer service are a disgrace and yes, I 100% mean a disgrace! We have waited in for 6 failed attempts for a 50cm carcass wardrobe which apparently keeps getting stuck in their system. No one in customer service helps to solve the problem and when you escalate it as a complaint they can't transfer you as they have to email someone. We even spoke to the warehouse yesterday and they said it was on the picking list for today....once again no call or message just another non-delivery for the sixth time. We honestly don't know how to stop this cycle of frustration and nonsense and after 4 weeks still have 3/4 of a wardrobe sitting upstairs. If you are reading this and considering buying something which requires delivery I honestly wouldn't....and never will again.",Trustpilot_USA
Hours on the phone only to be hung up on . The time to speak to anyone is ridiculous. Over an hour on hold with multiple people to get to someone who can possibly fix your issue. I was told I would receive a replacement part within 5-7 business days. On business day 10 I called again and after 48 minutes on the phone was told my case was cancelled and no part was being sent because I did not have my original receipt. This was AFTER being told the part was ordered and on the way to me. I asked to speak with a supervisor and the CSR kept telling me they would tell me the same thing. When I insisted they put me on hold another 20+ minutes telling me no supervisor was currently available and then strangely disconnected after over an hour on the phone. My first phone call was 1 hour and 32 minutes long. Their customer service is a joke. They take no ownership and give no solutions for replacement pieces for their broken parts. I will no longer be purchasing from them and advise you to only buy items you know will never need replacement...unlike the particle board drawer set that I paid way too much for.,Trustpilot_USA
"IKEA biggest ever missed opportunity to nail delivery in the pandemic . How can IKEA spend the pandemic making a real hash of simple things like online delivery? They should have been all over this and had the opportunity to really nail this with great warehouse hubs located in ideal regional locations.

Instead, deliveries are two weeks or longer (if they actually have the part in stock....anywhere), and then when boxes arrive, they immediately fall apart in the delivery guy's hands, because whoever packed it didn't use enough tape.

"Ugly customer service during pandemia time. . Yesterday I went to Ikea Montreal since I needed couple of screws to be able to assembly my son’s changing table. There was a line of about 40 people I had to pass before I was able to tell some one to provide me with 4 screws missing. That is just ridiculous! We are all dealing with the pandemia and I havent seen a store like that. They put everyone in a line before they are classified according to their needs. Very bad management!. Yesterday I felt like I rather buy my stuff somewhere else, so scary to need to reach customer service there. What was amazingly easy was to go inside and buy something. All normal! The message I got between lines was: We sell you what you need to buy, just dont come back to bother us or we will give you an special treatment :(. I think Customer service management should do much better than that. What a shame, i used to like Ikea’s products.

"WAS WEARY - ANXIOUS FOR NO REASON . I purchased a foam mattress from IKEA’s website. I didn’t do any research and after is when I began to look up reviews (my brain is backwards, we get it). I got myself so worked up reading review after review of horrible experiences; people claiming that they never received their item, it never even went out for delivery, the wrong product came, etc. I was actually debating on cancelling and contacting customer service before I even gave them a chance, and to just take my money elsewhere and invest in another company, even if the prices could be a bit more expensive.
I got a call two days prior to my delivery date stating that my mattress was shipped and being brought to a closer facility, and was told that it was going to be delivered on Sep. 1st. The next day, the day before my delivery, I got the same call, but this time it notified me of a time frame, which was that the mattress would be delivered anywhere from 11am-3pm. Today, I got the call from a delivery driver at about noon stating that they were roughly five minutes away. Sure enough, they were! Smooth, perfect delivery. They placed the mattress in my garage where I told them and that was that. And my mattress is comfortable (although it still needs time to fluff up all the way)!",Trustpilot_USA

I had spoken with two different agents and no one advised of this. When I called the piece that comes separate costs $15 and would cost to ship. I decided it was too much after it all so decided to return the slats. They advised I’d have to take it back to a store now. My main reason for having it shipped is bc I’m no where near an IKEA.

"IKEA delivery/logistics in UK are very poor, beware before you order. . Our furniture for the new flat was supposed to arrive today. IKEA was supposed to SMS me with the delivery slot 1-2 days prior to delivery. I got suspicious as this never happened. When I checked my order tracking online, it said ""Waiting to be picked"". When I checked what this meant, I saw that it meant the items needed to be picked up from a warehouse. At that moment I realized that there was an issue so I called them to learn that the delivery will not happen today and the next slot they can book for me is 28 days later, which is not only very late but also coincided with travel for me. So in the end I had to cancel the order and ask for a refund. Very disappointed with IKEA regarding this. They could at least notify me that there is a delay with my shipment which they did not.

I placed the order and had a hard time because it would not let me input the full address so I had to call and do it over the phone (more time consuming). Finally got the order placed.
I days later get a text that they tried to deliver my order to the warehouse but couldn't please call. I called and was told it wasn't open when they tried to deliver it. Note that I told the rep that this was a warehouse it had to deliver during business hours and repeated this several times while on the phone. They tried to deliver at 9PM So went through everything again and the IKEA rep put me on hold to reach out to company they contracted to get this set up to deliver following day. I was on hold forever and got disconnected. Rep called me and left a message that it could deliver the next day to call her back. I call her back and no one can get me connected with Jackie. I said get a message to her that delivery next day was good and thank her. Fast forward to today I realize I never got confirmation of delivery. Call IKEA and it was never delivered and never attempted. So did not make it in time for our show. Yet no one bothered to call me at all or reach out.
I asked for an explnation and the have no notes nothing from Jackie in the system she did not put anything in there from the day we spoke. WHAT????? So ask them to do the ""RIGHT"" thing and I would now like for it to be shipped to my warehouse where I store our booth properties. NOPE they told me I had to cancel the order and reorder. I asked what they were going to do to help me since it was IKEA in the wrong....they literally told me NOTHING. We can cancel the order.

The delivery guys tried twice, second time with a lift but gave up. It was unrealistic from the start. Now IKEA wants us to organize a crane and pay for it. So we have to coordinate it and then contact IKEA about when we have it ready. So IKEA push all responsibility on customer when things go wrong.

Everyone’s health and wellbeing is our top priority, so we ask that you continue to follow the Government guidance in your local area and follow these simple rules: wear a face covering, use hand sanitiser and keep a safe distance from each other.
Well we arrived at lunchtime and headed to the cafe for a sandwich, due to the layout they have with single queues snaking back on itself it it impossible to have any social distancing with other customers. We onyl wanted a sandwich and to be able to get on with our shopping we had to queue for 30 min with everyone else just to get a sandwich. The uptake of masks by IKEA employees was about 1/3 for the staff we saw around the store how surely they should be leading by example to the customers.

* i'd have to call ikea everyday to check & request to put items aside for the order if an item is available. Ikea will not do it. Again, everytime i made a call, had to wait at least 30min before able to talk to a rep, and then transferred 2 more times (10 minutes waiting the between).

Months later I get an email saying my order has been delivered, but it hasn't. When I check with FedEx they say they never received the order from IKEA and confirm that no delivery was made. When I check with IKEA, (which is a very time-consuming process involving talking to multiple departments) I am told that indeed nothing has shipped and they do not know what is going on so they cancel the order and refund my money. Great, I have my money back but I'd really rather have gotten what I ordered or been told they can't process my order so I could go buy it someplace else without waiting months, tying up my money and wasting a lot of my time :( PS I have all this documented if anybody from IKEA is interested and would like to review it.",Trustpilot_USA
"Worst company ever . Worst company ever! I installed the PAX closet system months ago and have been unable to complete it because the drawers I need are not in stock... for months. I was issued a $60 gift card for the trouble BUT a week later, when I had not received the gift card, I called and sat on hold for 45 mins only to be told that it hadnt funded. A week after that, I called and sat on hold for 45 mins again and was told that it funded the day of my last call and would not be available to me for another potentially 14 days. Who the hell issues a gift card for inconvenience and then makes it EXTREMELY inconvenient to even get!??? Here is the kicker, the drawers I need might actually be in stock for me to purchase tomorrow at my local store...maybe but I wont be able to use my gift card!

"Delivery is USELESS . Placed a large order of shelves. Waited 3 months for the products. Then the delivery company picked them up at IKEA and has a robot call me to tell me what 4 hour window the following day they will deliver. There is no way to tell the robot or a human you will not be home at that time ON A SUNDAY. So, the truck driver calls you from your door when you don't answer, but cannot reschedule. IKEA then calls to reschedule, but again, can't tell you when the delivery will be, starting the entire ridiculous process all over again. Astounding how amazingly stupid and useless this delivery process and coordination is in the era of Amazon!

Oh yeah . . to add even more frustration, every call I've made to IKEA has been OVER AN HOUR on hold mostly. The delivery company is called ""NAL Group"" . . they NEVER ANSWER and their website is useless!",Trustpilot_USA

They promised a delivery date, which I changed all my plans for but no one came. No one apologised for the inconvenience, their website says wrong opening times for their customer service, I’ve had to call them 4 times to get this sorted and wait 20 mins minimum on the phone each time and have had to sleep on a tiny couch for almost 2 weeks and the most they could offer was a £30 voucher.

Customer service refuses to send a replacement, says my ONLY option is to drive all the way back and retrieve the pieces or return the whole thing (literally 100’s of pieces big and small, all unboxed). Refused to let me talk to another representative, refused to have item picked up.

"An absolute nightmare . I wish I could give Ikea 0 stars. I have never in my life had such a difficult time with them, but this will be the last time I ever purchase anything from them. I moved across the country, therefore, needed new furniture. I tried to order from Ikea. Everyday something would be out of stock. It would say it was in stock in my nearest store, but not in stock for delivery. It made no sense. Fast forward to 10 days ago, I am able to place my order (a desk chair, a bed, and a desk). I am forced to pay $200 for delivery. Whether this was for distance or not, I do not know, but they did not deserve $200. One of my boxes came wet, damaged, and half open. I put together the entire bed. I realize I am missing the wooden slats that are meant to support the mattress. I cannot use the bed. I go to put the chair together. I am missing THE ACTUAL SEAT OF THE CHAIR. THE USABLE PART OF THE CHAIR. I am furious. I call customer service. The woman says these items are on back order (I never got an email saying these items are on back order, she said there is no automated system to inform customers of such news). I will have to wait for another email to reschedule delivery. There is nothing she can do. She tells me the items will be back in stock on Wednesday (4 days after my requested, $200 delivery date). I call Tuesday to follow up. Somehow, this person knows even less than the previous person. Again, I am told there is nothing she can do. She doesn't know when the items are coming back in stock. All I have to do is wait and hope that I get an email to reschedule delivery. I check the website. The items are in stock in my nearest store (140 miles away, I have no car, hence why I paid for delivery). She says ""oh, that's the stock for our store. Our online warehouse is different."" Makes sense? Wednesday comes. I call again. This time, a more competent person answers the phone. She asks if I have a case number and if I made sure to call within the 48 reporting period for missing delivery items. I have called customer service 3 times now and was never told about either of these things. This woman creates a case number for me. She again cannot tell me when the items will be back in stock or when I can expect to have them. She says it's written somewhere on the website (I have yet to find it) that the delivery dates aren't guaranteed. Even though, you pay an obscene amount for delivery, they cannot even ensure you will have all your items on the day you choose. She says she tagged my case with ""high priority"" and someone will call within 24 hours. All three times, I asked for a refund considering I did not get what I paid for. I was told the only compensation they could provide would be store credit. As if after all this, I would shop there again. Today, no one called within the 24 hour period. I call again. I am told that yesterday's customer service agent refunded me for the two missing items. I said that I never asked to be refunded. Once I was told I could not be, I said never mind. I want/need the items. The lady says they are out of stock and they will be until September 11th although she sounds incredibly uncertain of this. There is nothing she can do, so I hang up. I was forced to buy the bed slats from Amazon for $80. That is $50 more than on Ikea's site. I called customer service 5 times, and no one was willing or able to remedy my situation or provide customer service. I am a student who just moved to a new state. I have been sleeping on the floor for a week and will probably do so for another week. Good customer service would have been having someone deliver my items from my closest store. Good customer service would have been informing me that the items were on back order, that I might not receive what I ordered, or informing me that I am being refunded and my order is being canceled. Good customer service would have been NOT SELLING THE ITEMS IF THEY DO NOT EXIST. IF SUPPLY CANNOT MEET DEMAND, DO NOT TRICK YOUR CUSTOMERS INTO THINKING THEY WILL HAVE YOUR ITEMS ON A CERTAIN DAY. To top it all off, I am unable to leave a review on Ikea's website as there is no option to do so. When contacting their agents via live chat, the agent left the chat after I said I was unable to leave a review. I am absolutely appalled that Ikea, a global brand, would treat their customers so poorly, would hire such clueless customer service reps, and would do absolutely nothing to fix this problem. I will never shop there again, and I will ensure no one I know does either.",Trustpilot_USA

I wrote to them (with photos and of receipts). I got back a very well expressed apology and money back. It was extremely impressive as so often IKEA is complained about for a variety of issues. I like the store very much but have had reservations on occasions - usually because I’m so tired by the time I’ve got round it - but I have to say that in this instance their customer service was second to none.

IKEA should learn a thing or two from other online retailers. They're losing profit by failing to have stock available for sale.

Yes, they have email/SNS restock notifications. But they aren't worth signing up for because when I go to order online, it goes out of stock (within minutes)!

"Delivery service is bad, customer service is worse . I ordered a Friheten sectional with the room-of-choice-delivery because I do not have a car where I live. The delivery service delivered the boxes quickly and efficiently, in and out in under a couple minutes. After they left, I realized a box was damaged, the particle board on the inside was clearly busted without having to open the box. I am quite confident they were aware of the damage because of how the boxes were positioned (They also had to navigate an elevator and hallway, so plenty of opportunities to see the damage).

I contacted customer service, and after being on hold for 30 minutes, I was told the item was not in stock for delivery and could not be replaced. There was no way to pre-order it, no way for them to call me back, etc. My only options were to call back every day (and they have long hold times) to try to get a replacement or they could offer me a refund. I went the refund route, and they said they would be in contact regarding a pickup. It should have been a red flag that they couldn't schedule that on the initial call.

Days go by, still no response from them, so I call again, and they are going to escalate the call. Due to the price, they cannot offer a refund until they have received the item back. Keep in mind I have large sectional size boxes that are taking up apartment space.

A week goes by, still no response. I notice that the product is back in stock, so I call again to see what my options are for a replacement instead. I am told I will need to purchase this out of pocket because they have to have the original box back. They cannot pick up the box when they deliver the new one either. I am also told that they are unable to do pickups at this time, but if I hold on to it for ""a few months"", they should be able to pick it up and refund me at that time.

Ultimately I borrowed a car after 5 weeks, and spent the several hours returning the box. Because the Ikea was in a different state, I also got back less sales tax on the refund. They would not refund the delivery fee as promised on the phone calls because there were a couple of other small items on the initial order. On top of that the replacement was still a little damaged, but not worth the hassle (which I believe is their goal in customer service).

A few takeaways for me:
1 - I was promised a call back after every call made, but have not received a single one.

2 - Every Ikea customer service reps had a different interpretation of the situation. For a company this well thought out and efficient, I have to assume that it is their goal to be as unhelpful as possible so that people give up on getting their refunds.

3 - The reviews on their site are curated. I usually receive an email to leave a review after a purchase, but when I had a problematic order, that email was conveniently not sent out. I am seeing other recent reviews for this item though. Maybe it is a coincidence, but I no longer trust them as a company.

4 - Between calls, having to borrow a vehicle and return it on my own (while also still being out the cost of shipping and some sales tax) I have spent at least 8 hours dealing with them, still have a slightly damaged sectional, and an intense anger towards them as a company.",Trustpilot_USA

"PAX systems - do not buy! . The reason IKEA Canada is getting one star is that a) I can't rank them lower and b) their freezing bags are durable and close well. Too bad their furniture doesn't meet the expectations any longer (fair price for fair quality).
I bought two PAX wardrobes with sliding doors. Not only did IKEA not have all of the items ready for delivery at the time of order (bought online and paid for delivery in May 2021), but for the missing pieces, I had to place a separate order and go to the other side of the town to pick them up (why their ERP system doesn't create a back-order immediately and IKEA takes responsibility for delivery is beyond my ability to comprehend).
Had I known that the side panels would come already scratched (they don't even recommend the touch up-paint for a given market), that the screws would be missing (who's gonna line-up in a hardly moving line-up for 4 screws?!) and above all, that some of the hardware would come loosely assembled (and of course, something like that we didn't notice until it was too late), I would have never bought these. I certainly overpaid for both the quality and experience.

"The worst shopping experience of my adult life . I wish I could explain this nightmare without putting readers to sleep.
IKEA must have some form of new policy that says that if a customer has an complaint they must ignore, lie, generally caused this customer as much stress and anxiety as humanly possible.
I purchased a new sofa on the 06/07/2021, unfortunately the seating cushions appeared to small for the covers, there was excessive amounts of material.
so I immediately rang IKEA for help.
I was advised that someone would have to call and look at the issue and I would receive an email on the Friday confirming the appointment on the following Monday.
Neither of these things happen.
I again rang IKEA but was advised they had No record of this, which shocked me.
I was then advised that they could replace the settee but unfortunately there were no stock in any of my local stores so I would have to wait for a replenishment.
Sometime passed so again I rang and made a logical suggestion to a customer service representative.
I suggested seeing that it’s only the seating cover and pads that are affected could they not just order replacement parts, the lady agreed and ordered a free set of new covers and two new seating pads apparently from your lakeside store, I thought great sorted so I thought.sometime later Royal Mail turned with ONE seating pad with the same reference number I was given by customer service it was also 18 centimeters smaller than my exiting sofa cushion, obviously from a completely different sofa.
I was furious and rang IKEA again, the stupidity didn’t end there on that particular day, they also advised that the order for the free replacement covers had been canceled because it hadn’t been paid for.
The person who I spoke to called Chris assured me that the replacement covers were still on order and the two seating pads still hadn’t been picked from the lakeside store.
He had no idea what or why had been delivered to me that day.
He said this was due to happen on the 02/08/2021.
Today the 05/02/2021 I still haven’t received either.
What I have received is an email on Response on Resolver informing me that the sofa and covers are discontinued I was absolutely incensed with anger at IKEA incompetence and lies.
I have replied to the email and received a response from an idiot saying he couldn’t trace any previous case numbers or emails so I downloaded the entire case and forwarded that via Resolver.

"Shame I have to put a star . Shame I have to put a star, I would rather put none.
The experience with IKEA customer service was dreadful. I bought a bed for my teenage son and just under 2 years, the slats kept on fallen off the bed. I was sent an expert to check if the bed was faulty and as I could not show the whole bed (my son has a diagnosis of autism and will let no one in his room) so I showed him the slats which most of them were not holding together due to the cheap fabric that are between them. The expert confirmed that he will get me some new slats and I would have settled for this, as I could not show the whole bed. IKEA were not understanding of the fact that my son has a disability and I wasn’t able to show the whole bed.They called me about 2 weeks ago, on a Sunday 25/07/2021 and never bothered to call me back even though today is the 05/08/2021. Therefore, I called them and even though they advertised 10 min wait, I waited 20 min. Then, I spoke to the customer service agent who put me on hold for another 10 min. She failed to ask me if I preferred a call back rather than waiting yet again. After this, she told me that the bed is not faulty, even though the slats won’t hold on the frame. The bed has a 25 years guarantee and it did not last 2 years. Very poor customer service and product quality.

"IKEA Delivery Not Turning Up Week After Week. . IKEA charged me £40 for delivery telling me they were splitting my order into 2 delivery dates: 2 and 3 weeks after ordering (the first containing smaller items to be delivered by parcel, second: large items by van).

I waited in all day for the parcel delivery - nothing came. I received an email at 8:05pm telling me something went wrong and that it might be that an item isn't in stock. Why couldn't they have told me that the day before or even during the day?!
They said my new delivery date would now be in another 2 weeks time.
The website showed that the van delivery was still coming a week later alongside this new date for the parcel a week after that.

A week later, I again waited in, the van delivery didn't arrive and no email received this time. I can only assume that everything will be delivered on the new delivery date for the parcel (which is over 4 weeks from the date I made the order).

Sent link to choose date and time. 2 men who didn't know each other arrived via TaskRabbit. I guy completed 1 wardrobe and left after 2 hrs. The other guy arrived late and after 4 hrs told us he'd never assembled this type of wardrobe and had to leave to go to another job! Incomplete wardrobe left with 1 door propped against the wall. Door fell over onto floor and broke. Grimo door made from cheap rubbish board. Ikea quality has plummeted.,Trustpilot_USA

"Would leave minus stars if I could. . Never dealt with such a bad company.
Drove all the way to IKEA in Warrington to buy a wardrobe and a chest of drawers. We spent £260 on both and then realised the boxes were far too big to fit into my car. Our only option was to go to the home delivery desk and get them delivered to our home. IKEA claim to be able to send the products to your home the very same day. We were told this was not possible as they couldn’t even contact the people who deliver the products. They told us they could deliver the next day between 12pm-6pm. We paid £29 and then received a message later in that evening saying the delivery would actually be between 12pm-4pm. On the day we received no correspondence from the delivery company or IKEA and the products were not delivered between that time, despite calling them multiple times and they told us it would be delivered in that time. They then told us it would be delivered before 6pm. It did not show. We must have called 14 times that day to the customer service IKEA and we’re told blatant lies each time. We were told it would then 100% be delivered before 7pm and that the delivery man was actually on his way to ours. Still no show. We were eventually told it would not be arriving that day and we would receive a phone call the next day between 8am-10am. No call. After ringing twice again they then told us they had no idea where our products were and had no idea if or when they would be delivered. We were then that frustrated we wanted a full refund for the products and the delivery and were told we would have to drive all the way back to the Warrington store to get a refund. When we arrived at the Warrington store, to our amazement. Our wardrobe and chest of drawer boxes were on the trollies exactly where we left them in the store. They hadn’t even been moved from where we set them on the day of purchase. The refund assistant on till had once again, no idea what was going on noe did the manager, Chris. The assistant or Chris didn’t even greet us or apologise for the inconvenience this had caused us. Absolutely shocked by the service and will never ever be shopping with IKEA again, I will also be telling everyone I know of the shocking service they provide.

I have bought many pieces of furniture here in the last 1.5 years: 2xPAX for clothes, book shelves, coffee table, tv stand, sofa... actually I furnished my home fully from IKEA slowly, one by one, except for the kitchen as it was already there.

Delivery for the bigger pieces is good, they called me before etc.

Two things they could fix:

Hemnes single bed makes a squeaky noise. The two stiffening rods (is that the correct word?!) installed in a V shape under the mattress. They were also hard to install as the rod where one must screw the screw did not have a proper screw thread. Anyway eventually it worked. The squeaking can be helped with a bit of insulating tape. Installation would be easier using screws with a counterpart.

No delivery dockets with orders so 100 boxes approx arrived, no way of knowing if anything missing. all deliveries need a delivery docket for this purpose.
We start building the kitchen, no counter top. 4 weeks of contacting IKEA and noone can find the item. No staff can let me talk to a manager. No person can return my call. 4 weeks after missing item was notified to Ikea and no move forward.

Last night I receive a curt mail stating they can't find it and now have reordered.
Was due June 19th, now due 16th August.
When you build a kitchen, you take out the old. So there is no kitchen and no water, for 2 months.
Not once did Ikea apologise.
Had they have responded internally i wouldn't have lost 4 weeks before they reordered.

So my advice is: Can you afford to live with half a kitchen for 2 months? If not, you might want consider shopping elsewhere.

I then asked for a discount, as all my things have been and are currently on the floor and I am not able to use the kitchen for more than 50%, and Ikea refused to grant me a discount and propose the installation of provisory doors at my cost. I proposed Ikea to pay for the provisory solution and refused to do so, claiming system issues :).

So, 4 months later we still have an oven that burns half the food while the other half remains raw. Ikea continue to tell us that it's not their responsibility to fix this issue, despite it clearly being stated in EU law that it is clearly their responsibility.",Trustpilot_USA

"Schlechter Kundenservice . We used Ikea kitchen planning service

General view
1) It took them 2 weeks to respond to our online request
2) the kitchen planner sometimes forgot what was agreed in our previous discussion. Some were even written in the email but he ignored it.
3) there’s no way to contact the kitchen planner when the order went wrong. We were only allowed to call customer services. However, the customer service always said, “this is kitchen department issue. Please contact your kitchen planner.” And surprisingly the only way to contact the kitchen planner was to write email to him but he didn’t respond. Response rate: ca. 1 out of 5 emails. And then we fell into a vicious circle or a dead end to be more precise.
4) customer service staff are not well trained. one of them even hanged up the call without advice, explanation or assistance. (Ps. I did speak German to customer service. Very sure it was not language issue)

Key Incidents (what went wrong so that we finally understood how terrible IKEA service could be)

Incident 1) we booked and paid for the dishwasher through our kitchen planner. Namely, it was in stock when we paid for it. However, the order was canceled one sided by IKEA all of the sudden one day before the scheduled delivery date. And we tried to call customer services. They said “sorry out of stock.” (So what’s the point for us to pay for it that earlier and trust it would be delivered before the installation guys came?) In the end, Amazon saved us.

Incident 2) the kitchen planner forgot to make the booking for the fridge. We noticed this issue only one week before the scheduled installation services, which had became urgent. After trying to call customer service many times, we finally managed to get one customer service who could help us book the fridge without delivery fees as this should have been part of our kitchen package. (Btw, the kitchen planner still hid himself somewhere even we had emailed him about this missing fridge. No response still until today.)

However, the customer service later called telling us he could rebooked the delivery of the fridge on the same date as other bookings. We said fine. Soon after we received a cancellation email of the fridge but no further rebooking. So we called customer service. They confirmed yes it’s canceled. We asked “could you booked it for us again?” This time, they responded “no can do. Please contact your kitchen planner.” After calling so many times and talking to different kitchen planners from different locations, they all said they could book it but with extra 99€ delivery fee. (yes our kitchen planner was just gone.) in the end, given the installation guys would be coming soon, we ordered it through one kitchen planner and paid for the fridge including delivery fee.

And, and, and, finally the installation was finished although some doors are still missing. We happily thought that we would never need to speak to IKEA service people anymore. What a relief…. But the IKEA torture just returned today — we received an invoice from customer service for that fridge they never delivered let alone there’s no Auftrag Bestätigung for that fridge in our email inbox at all…. (this is the last draw to let me decide to write down our story on a public platform.)

Thank you for reading our long complaint to this end ;)

(Update: Just called customer services - they insisted that the fridge was delivered in ""their"" system. they asked us to go to the Einrichtungshaus again because the delivery was arranged by them. Again, IKEA one-sided decide what to invoice without a proof of delivery, our signature, not to mention there's even no Auftrag Bestätigung from us. How dare IKEA issue such an invoice like that? Their management and integrity are both questionable.)

Conclusion: Doing business with IKEA is time and energy consuming at the same time. Think twice before placing any order of any IKEA goods or services.",Trustpilot_USA

"Disability discrimation and insults at Ikea Edinburgh . Edinburgh customer service

Today I received the most dismissive, arrogant treatment from Jamie on Information Desk. I was complaining about the process for ordering, paying and collecting bulky items and hiw it could be clearer and easier. He

1. Did not look at me
2. Did not acknowledge my complaint
2. Did not say a word whilst processing my paperwork and didn't explain when he made a mistake and had to reprint
3. Tossed my paperwork at me
4. When I said 'thanks for nothing' he waited until I walked away and then shouted after me 'thanks for your happy disposition' then laughed at me with the next customer

"Surprisingly not terrible! . Rather surprised to say my experience with customer support at Ikea was actually nice.

After waiting more than two months for a delivery (in itself, pretty terrible service, but at any rate the order was placed during lockdown so I could not at that time go to Ikea to collect my items myself and the soonest delivery date was two months away, okay, fine whatever) and nothing arriving/no correspondence from them for 15 days past the date the delivery was supposed to arrive, I decided to get in touch.

Email contact disabled. Live chat disabled due to ""high volume"" (gee, Ikea, wonder why). There was, however a local number. Forum after forum warned me I wouldn't get anywhere with the number but I had to try something. Being patient about ""COVID delays"" could only go so far, man.

I was through to a super friendly and accommodating staff member pretty much straight away, who was able to tell me the order had been damaged and placed on hold. Apparently, no one had thought to tell me (cute, Ikea). They were able to offer me either a refund or a redelivery in a short window of time and cleared everything up really quickly.

Four stars because this was genuinely a helpful and pleasant experience. Star off because I had to initiate it myself and because it's simply not good enough to have just one contact option in 2021 with so many people looking for work.",Trustpilot_USA

As soon as something goes wrong, you'll pay a bigger price than any saving you intended to make on the cost of the product. It's no coincidence they don't have a complaints procedure (just a feedback form) and don't allow customers to post reviews on certain products!

I ordered the Farlov 2-seater sofa bed for £795, which arrived with 2 screws missing and as a result would derail when trying to use the bed function. IKEA's customer services are so incompetent they were unable to send the correct screws to the store or in the post. Instead, they sent round an 'eco master' (engineer) to resolve the issue. Although he was able to replace the missing screws, the bed broke upon first use. After sending another engineer, who confirmed it's broken, I was told I'd be hearing from them soon. Unsurprisingly, after a week I'd heard nothing and again had to chase them.

I've spent hours now trying to get a refund/exchange, I'm continuously told lie upon lie by their agents e.g. you'll receive a call within 24 hours, which never materialises. I've now been given a date for collection for a refund (though I have to disassemble the sofa myself), but even this has been rescheduled.

Already I read someone else write a comment about the same problem, that a piece of the inner layer comes out. Why IKEA doesn't let people put more comments?. Anyone else can do it?. Why is not any way to claim or complaint online in the website?. The chat and email and contact options on the website is currently unable because of the covid-19 they have put it there. Honestly, I cannot trust anymore in IKEA for serious things like pots, pans etc after this. Maybe for things I am not gonna eat only.

Again… no communication from IKEA. No email, text or phone call. It’s just common courtesy. The gentleman said they would redeliver another day which we begrudgingly agreed to only to be told there’s no guarantee it will arrive on that day and that we would be best ringing up two days before to check it would arrive. Why is that my job as the customer? It is the most basic level of customer service to keep customers up to date on their order. We then cancelled the order and we’re told as a gesture of good will…. That they would also refund the delivery charge. Big round of applause IKEA. Thank you so much for refunding me for the delivery that you never delivered. Oh and the icing on the cake, if our refund isn’t in our account within 10 days… we need to ring and chase that up too. Safe to say we won’t be ordering again in a hurry.

"UNACCEPTABLE Customer service . Today, after having been ignored through the Facebook message channel since Saturday, I resorted to contacting customer service through their online chat on their website.
The issue was about a room divider which was showing up as in stock in the Dublin store (which I had also received an email about telling me it was in stock) but when I actually got to the store it was not there even though the live update was still saying 2 left in stock.
I was very annoyed as I had paid for my own transportation service to collect this item in store as it was too big to fit in a regular car. I didn't want the same thing happening again when the item came back into stock.
But I have NEVER EVER received such bad customer service! Having waited in the virtual queue for an eternity a person named Dovile responded and eventually told me they could ring the store for me before I arrived next time. I thought this was unacceptable and at the very minimum they should have offered free delivery to compensate me for my last failed trip but I was told that couldn't happen.
I then asked could they provide the number to ring before my next trip as previously offered and the chat very conveniently encountered a 'system failure' and HASN'T OPENED BACK UP SINCE!! Coincidence..

"Beware Of This Information By IKEA! - Bad Information . Okay everyone listen up. Despite on the website that it says the following statement - scroll below my text. This is far from the truth!!! As I bought a vanity unit which is too big for my bathroom due to my designer getting it completely wrong. I appreciate not IKEA's fault but delighted to find out they do take assembled furniture back, which I think is a really good service and USP. I lugged the whole unit and washbasin and IKEA refused to refund or give me vouchers. There is this back buy scheme? Which applies to second hand furniture. Admirable indeed, but not good in my case. I am so dissappointed that the reverse was told to me. Be really careful when you buy things from this Company! As the ample information I found about them accepting returned assemble furniture is not TRUE. HQ IKEA any chance you can make an exception or bring this policy back for customers? I am now stuck with £200 item which I do not need. Happy to except vouchers. I am gutted that this policy no longer exists. Bad move in my opinion!
SEE STATEMENT
(NOT CORRECT) IKEA does have a great return policy. Customers can return products up to 365 days after the initial purchase, even if the furniture has been assembled. If IKEA agrees that the product is unused and in resalable conditions, the store will issue a full refund.

So we went on line, designed everything with there tools and went to the store which is over an hour ride from us. This is in 1/19/2021. The staff helped us put everything in (Several thousands of dollars) and we paid for delivery at the tune of 100 bucks. They said some of the stuff in back ordered due to the pandemic and we understood. They delivered the 1st part of the order which not 1 single thing was available to put together in 2 weeks. They said about 60 days or less and we will deliver the rest of it. We agreed. 60 days rolled around and dead silence, Not a text, call, or e-mail. I called and got a huge run around.

"TERRIBLE . Hi,

I am EXTREMELY trustee dated with ikea. I placed an order on March 8th for a wardrobe system to be delivered originally on Saturday, April 10th. I got a call Friday April 9th in the morning saying the system was coming that morning when I was already at work and was unable to be there for the delivery to be made. Later on after hours on hold trying to speak to a representative, I was told the shipment would be coming at a later time. Finally got an email saying the delivery would be pushed back to May 10th. I had my grandma come to my apartment in the morning because I had still yet to receive a call as to the delivery window but the night before I spoke to an ikea rep. And he told me that the delivery was definitely coming that day. My grandma could only stay a half day so I worked a half day and on my way home from I was hit by a van and badly injured all because I was heading home to try to get this delivery. I have a police report filed and I will be bringing this to my local news channel to investigate as to why ikea has terrible customer service and where my wardrobe is because I am starting to think ikea doesn’t even have it. I will also be emailing the CEO my police report for my injury Now after speaking to multiple rep.s and being promised that my ikea wardrobe was brought from a warehouse in Long Island last week that it would be in a warehouse in the city to be put on a delivery route today, I have yet to get any call or email. I paid a lot of money for this and Ikea has terrible customer service. This is TWO MONTHS LATER and I have yet to receive this item. I need this ASAP.

"IKEA Hokassen Mattress . We have had similar poor quality issues with the Hokassen mattress as in the review below. Ours is probably worse as the mattress was rarely used, it was only on the guest bed. The sides have started sagging, showing that the springs do not extend the full width, the foam sides sag and do not support. I will never buy an IKEA mattress again and consider them very very poor value for money.
""Poor quality, meaningless warranties & horrible customer service
I purchased a mattress from the Amsterdam location of Ikea in 2018. We went for the slightly higher-end HOKASSEN model, which cost us around €500. After just two years, one side of the mattress started caving in - it appears the layer of foam around the mattress has separated from the core. I contacted Ikea's customer service team about this issue, as their website claims all mattresses come with a 25-year warranty. After weeks of slow communication and lots of back-and-forth with the customer service team on Facebook messenger, they finally connected me to the claims team. They then asked for additional information and photos, only to then reply back saying: ""We have started to process your enquiry and have thoroughly examined your photos. Considering this information, we have concluded that the damage stated is caused by circumstances that lie outside the product itself, e.g. daily use, impacts from dropping or falling, or incorrect use of the product."" So apparently ""daily use"" is considered a legitimate reason to void the warranty, even though the Terms and Conditions say nothing of the sort. According to the T&C: ""The claim must not be the result of incorrect use of the product, such as dropping it, knocking it over, using it for a purpose other than that for which it was intended, not maintaining it properly, or having it repaired by a third party."" I replied with this information and asked for further explanation from the services team and never received a reply. So after over a month of emailing about the damage with my mattress, I end up ghosted by Ikea. One of the worst customer service experiences I've ever had. For anyone thinking about buying a mattress from Ikea, be warned -- the mattresses are not made to last and the warranty is worth nothing more than the paper it's printed on.""",Trustpilot_USA
"Do not shop with them - it's an absolute nightmare . IN SHORT: They didn't deliver but they kept the money, and I have been wasting months dealing with their awful customer service.

I ordered and paid for a couch and a dresser online several months ago. Twice in a row, I was waiting for the delivery at home only for IKEA to suddenly reschedule it by several weeks in to the future. They then delivered about half the parts for the couch, and I had to figure out for myself that I would never receive the remaining parts and the dresser. They still charged me for shipping and the couch parts I had received, which are useless by themselves, and said that to get reimbursed I would have to deliver them back to an IKEA store (""we don't do pick ups right now""). Customer service was completely uncooperative and unreliable, I had to call them 4 times in total. Each time, I had to spend 2-3 hours on the phone, much of it on hold. Each time they made promises they then didn't keep -- when I'd call to check in, they'd have a new customer service person who said they had no knowledge of intentions to refund me for the random couch parts they had sent. They'd basically just tell me that there was nothing they could do. End result: about 10 hours on the phone (!!), several days of staying home to wait for them to deliver, and several months sitting in a half furnished apartment (I still have nowhere for my guests to sit). The nightmare is ongoing. I still don't have a couch or my money back. I wish I had the means to just have a lawyer handle it.",Trustpilot_USA

"Difficult to reach customer service . Amending my previous review. Online order was delivered late. It was marked as delivered for several hours, and it was not at my house or my neighbors' houses. Turns out it was the fault of the logistics company. Ikea customer service representatives were very helpful once I was able to get through, and the problem was resolved. I still spent several hours on hold, once just to talk to someone on their CS team, again while transferring between departments, and once again while their sales resolutions rep was on hold with the logistics company. Ikea really needs to improve their customer service availability. I spent half my day off waiting on hold for what amounted to one of their reps contacting the logistics company to resolve the issue. That could have been handled by email or an automated system with way less stress for me and their CS team, but the only way to contact Ikea is by waiting on the phone to speak with one of a limited number of representatives.",Trustpilot_USA

I was also looking for some storage units for my tickly woos bedrooms but you have to put the stuff together yourself and no one does it for you.

"IKEA unfinished Kitchen . We Purchased a Kitchen from Ikea last June and following many attempts to make contact eventually had the first part delivered at the end of July. Some more was deliverd in late August and the balance was never delivered. We luckily only paid for each consignment as it was being delivered, but this eft us with an incomplete kitchen. No worktop, some appliances missing, and a missing drawer. We subsequently purchased the worktop and appliances locally in Wexford. BUT found out to our horror that while these were standard sizes when we installed the integrated dishwasher the IKEA door didn't fit. We have a hole visible when the door is opened on the dishwasher where the hinge would be if it was used as a swinging door. The Kickboard under the units is stepped back from where the dishwasher Kickboard is. This has ruined the look and finish of our kitchen, The salesperson we dealt with when ordering our Kitchen no longer replies to our emails and advised us when she did last reply to order off the website, Very unsatisfactory. It has left us with an unfished Kitchen and very frustrated. So buyer beware if purchasing a kitchen from IKEA. And ensure it will fit in with and appliances you want to purchase elsewhere.

I call customer support and they said the driver said that the road was closed and cannot make delivery. Now I don’t know where they were coming from, but the main road to where I live is wide open and they only tried one way and that didn’t fit their driving schedule. How about taking a day off work and waiting all day for a delivery that isn’t happening cause you may have ran into a small roadblock. IKEA stated that it’s a third party delivery service they use.

"IKEA, the everyday nightmare! . My partner and I booked and paid in full for an IKEA kitchen with customised laminate kitchen worktop. This was for our first house. Kitchen and worktop were both supposed to come on 22.04.21. They sent us an automated email few days before delivery stating worktop would be delivered on 27.04.21. On the 27th the worktop did not arrive, after calling several times, with agents saying different things, they realised this worktop was lost. 4 days later, I received an email stating they found the worktop and after that, I received a call stating they had found it but they realised they had ordered the wrong one.
At this point, we had already moved in a house that still does not have a sink, a hob and a dishwasher installed. We are eating microwaveable ready food and washing our dishes in our bathtub.
Another order was made this time with delivery on 25.05.21. Few days after, this order was cancelled. With no explanation on why. No one contacting me to tell me what was happening. Yesterday another order was made with delivery date for the 4th of June!!! This means that IKEA has delayed my worktop for 44 days. This means 44 days without a drop of water in our kitchen. We found some panels to put on top of the cabinets that as they are not sealed, lots of dust goes in the draws.
So far no one of customer service has contacted me. No calls no emails. Except for a lady of the kitchen department. She's sorry but she cannot do anything about it. This is not very helpful is it?!

IKEA has transformed what should be a joyful moment such as moving in your first ever house in an absolute complete nightmare. My partner and I have families and friends who either live abroad or in different areas of the country. With the ease of lockdown, we could not wait for them to come and visit us and share some meals together on our new house, but this cannot be done until June the 4th.

"Returns only if never opened . Got an office chair online and everything went well until I needed to return it.
First, the wheels do not move and second it is so unfordable. I took it back to a store and they said they could take it back.
The first reason we removed the tags. We did not they shipped it to us like they. Of course, they said they wouldn't do that. I asked why would I remove tags on the bottom of a chair that no one saw. Kept telling them they shipped it that way.
Second, they said it was altered. It wasn't. Per them, I used it so it can be returned. I had it for a month and yes sat in it to see if one it would be good enough and two because I thought the wheels just needed a little time to loosen up. To them, this is altered and they can't resell it so they will not take it back.

I asked about the 180-day return policy and was told that is for open boxes never used.

They gave me 3, not 4 other wheels that didn't work either. And that was only because I demand it.

So, we take a day off work and drive the 5 plus hours to Dallas. When we get there and find the Pax system displays we had a hard time finding an employee to help with ordering what we needed. However, when we did get help, her name was Christina and she was the best thing about IKEA. She knew what she was doing and was extremely helpful in designing the closet system to fit our closet.
As luck would have it they did not have all of the pieces we needed but we could get close if the Frisco, TX. Store had the corner unit that the system showed in stock. It took over 45 minutes for her to get to talk to the other store to check stock. She got them to reserve the corner frames for us. She rings us up gives me the ticket for their store and a ticket to pay for the items at the Frisco store. Now they have you pull around back to a numbered parking spot and text them that you are ready for your items.
A young lady comes out with 2 carts full of boxes, stops at my truck, looks at the ticket and then leaves. Never comes back. So, apparently you have to load your furniture in the truck. Thankfully I am in good enough shape and not handicapped or elderly.
We drive to the Frisco store. I go in and ask a lady at the cash registers the best way to pay the ticket. She points me to a self-checkout. After I pay the bill I ask her if I have to pull around to a dock like the other store. She tells me “I just started here and don’t know” and walks off.
I go over to an in store counter with my ticket and ask the young man there the same question. He points at a TV screen, then my ticket and tells me “See these numbers, when they come up on the screen we can help you”. Okay, so it’s another 10 minute wait. My number pops up, I had them the ticket and they give me oversized boxes on a small cart and walk away. So now I get to push this cart thru the store and across the parking lot to my truck without the cart flipping over or the boxes sliding off. This time I am rescued by my wife who held the cart still while I wrestled the boxes into the truck.
Fast forward to today – 5-4-2021
I get online and try to order the 2 frames and the shelves that were out of stock. Surprise, the website won’t calculate delivery. I go to the chat box help. What do they recommend – They tell me I need to just go into the store instead of trying to order online and that they think the system must just be backed up and the warehouse is too busy to accept orders right now. I didn’t even bother to tell them it’s a 5 hour drive to go in the store.
IKEA has some really nice things and the prices are not horrible but if you don’t live close, you just have to hope when you get there they have what you were after because you sure can’t check any other way.",Trustpilot_USA
Terrible experience with the delivery service . Ordered a couch worth $700. Received a message in the morning saying that it should be delivered between 11am-3pm. Waited the entire day to know that the delivery failed at 7:30pm. Tried calling IKEA customer service multiple times during the work hours to track the status but nobody to answer.

Så jeg samler reolen og maler den der hvor skaden er så det ikke ses så meget.

Dagen efter jeg har samlet og malet den, modtager jeg så endeligt et svar fra IKEA! De skriver at jeg skal returnere den og modtage en ny reol. Jeg svare så at det ikke er muligt for mig at returnere og at jeg nu har valgt at beholde reolen, men om vi ikke kan finde ud af en refusion istedet så. IKEA spørger så om flere billeder af skaden, og jeg skriver så til dem at reolen nu er samlet og ""lappet"", men jeg sender dem alligevel flere billeder (jeg havde sendt billeder med i den 1. email jeg sendte til dem, hvor man kunne se skaden).

IKEA refuses to return funds . I made two online orders on 3/23 and 3/25 with an expected delivery date of 4/9. They cancelled one of the orders on 4/4 with no good reason and wouldn’t reinstate it when I called so I cancelled the second order since I wanted the furniture pronto. I never got anything so processing a refund on an order that they cancelled shouldn’t be that hard. As of 5/3 they still have over $4k of my money. Not sure why processing refunds on orders that were cancelled is so difficult in 2021. Using COVID as an excuse is deplorable.,Trustpilot_USA

"Worst in-store customer service . If you are wondering why #ikea has the worst customer service rating, this is a good example:
I was just trying to buy and get delivered furniture for 2 rooms for our village house...
After 1 month of trying to order online I realized that half of their products are always unavailable online, but available in the store...I don’t give up :).
It’s Good Friday and I have 2 hours between my 14m old baby naps, so I decide to go to the store and order on spot.
I arrive at the parking in the very “family friendly” store, I have to carry my not so light baby around until I find shopping cart or someone to direct me to such.
Yeahhh, finally I see one next to the entrance, but behind the bars...and since there is noone to direct me, I wander around for 15 min trying to find a way in the store with the trolley and I see a lady going up with the elevator. I follow and I end up at the EXIT.
There for God knows what reason there are 2-3 security people - so noone at the entrance, but everyone guarding the exit.
I am told that I can’t enter and I need to go all the way back, leave the trolley, carry my baby all the way up and eventually find one trolley there. All these while another lady that just went out is allowed to get back in right in front of me...I am told “these are the rules”, but I didn’t understand why they are valid for me and not the other lady, so I ask to see the manager.
After 10-15 min two ladies come out to explain that Ikea stores all around the world are badly organized and you have to carry around babies or you can take your own push-chair and push both and “these are the rules”.
Well, I confirm I understand their rules and I will consider going to Ikea with my child next time...However I am already there for more than 30-40 min with 14m old baby getting impatient, so would they be good to let me in, Mrs. Julia Mihaylova with the most cold blood look and tone said - these are the rules and went back in through the EXIT.
I guess this day, those rules were valid only for mothers with babies - not for other customers or employees...
So after I lost my 2 hours, I finally gave up to buy this furniture from #ikea...",Trustpilot_USA

The boxes showed up a day before delivery date with no communication. They were packaged incredibly poorly with the rug sheddings making a mess and the candles I had ordered wax all over the place where I had to vaccume everything. Then I was missing two items. No communciation about this. When I went on the website it just said at the bottom of my order that there was a refund for an amount that added up to these two items. It would have been fine if I had received communications earlier about these items being out of stock but I received NO communication. And I have no idea when I will receive this refund either.

IKEA Dublin:

After waiting for a month for a delivery, for a high price, even two of the items were damaged. One of them were dropped from the truck right in front of me. For the high price of delivery, I would expect a much better service.

When trying to contact them about this, I realized they don't have a CS email address, the live chat is not working, they don't pick up the phone.
So I have contacted them via FB Messenger.
They have answered once, asked for all my details and then silence, so I got no meaningful answers.
I don't know when IKEA sunk to this depth, but this is really pathetic.

Every professional company has a CS email address in the 21th century and you are an international company not an Instagram celeb.
We have no other choice, but to turn to customer protection agencies.
Sad.

EDIT - 2021-04-30:

Today I have received the replacement items and one of the items were damaged again. Out of 4 boxes in total, which is an achievement.
It will take another ""5-7 days"" to get this one which makes it more than a month waiting for this order.

"DON'T GET IN TRAP BY IKEA -EVEN ONE STAR IS TOO MUCH FOR IKEA . EVEN ONE STAR IS TOO MUCH FOR IKEA
I am writing this review because I really don't want anyone else experience my frustration with IKEA.
I went to IKEA to buy some furniture on finance for my new place 3 weeks ago.
One of the staff walked me through applying for IKEA credit card to be able to buy them on finance and I got approval and she provided me with a paperwork to give to cashier at the check out.
She told me that I would be eligible for a 6 month promotion if my purchase is under $600 but it would be eligible for a 10 month promotion if my purchase is more than a $1000.
So, I decided to purchase some furniture for a total of 1,251.00.
The next day, I received welcome emails from IKEA regarding my IKEA credit card, so I called them to schedule payments to prevent possible interests.
The customer service told me that I was only eligible for the 6 months promotion and not the 10 months.
I was frustrated but I decided to put some pressure on myself and pay it back in the 6 months. Then the customer service lady said that she couldn't not schedule any payments until I receive the physical credit card by mail in a couple of days.
After 2 weeks I received the credit card and I called them right away to set up an auto payment.
The customer service who was a gentleman apologized me saying that the IKEA staff had made a mistake and she had put me on another IKEA credit card that had no promotion. He suggested me to go to the IKEA location in Costa Mesa California where I purchased the furniture to explain the situation to their customer service and he said that the IKEA staff could call the contact number on the back of the credit card to help them to get it fixed.
So I took another trip to IKEA in Costa Mesa.
The customer service couldn't help me ,so they directed me to their supervisor, her name is KYLIE.
Although it was absolutely their staff mistake, she aggressively told me that she couldn't help me unless I apply for the other credit card with promotion then she would process a return/refund on my receipt and she would put them on new card with promotion. I accepted her offer but it was just the beginning of IKEA's trap.
She said that she wont be able to process the return until I return all the stuff back to IKEA.
I told her that they are all assembled and I have also paid for their assembly so she just needed to do the process on the paper without returning all those furniture back but KYLIE said that the furniture should be returned, also she will not even refund the whole money back because the furniture had been unpacked.
Also, I couldn't buy my furniture back any more.

It means that I needed to return furniture to get paid for part of my payment ,then I could apply for the other card, then I would go back to store to buy them all unassembled again.

"BAD EXPERIENCE . 02.06.21 - We bought 3 large items and some smaller ones. We live 2.5 Hours away from the store. We were told by a store rep that the 3 larger items were in stock. When we went to receive our large items, we were told that two of the items were located too high and couldn't be brought down until after hours and we could pick them up the next day. I argued a bit and stressed the fact that we lived 2.5 hours away, brought our truck which costs $50.00 a trip. No help there.
02.07.21 Returned to the store to pick up the 2 items. We picked them up and went home (2.5 hours - or 5 hours round trip) for another $50.00.
Upon arriving home removed all parts from one of the units and began assembly. Found a side of the cabinet (part) that was not constructed correctly. Being Sunday, I opened the other unit (same item) and it had the correct part. Completed assembly.
02.08.21 Called customer service, spent 2 hours, one on hold, explaining the issue. Was asked to circle the part in the assembly manual and take pictures of that and email them to the customer service person. I did so and verified with the person that they got the email. She said the part would ship in 3 to 5 days to my door.
After 2 weeks + of waiting for my part, I called the customer service line again (another hour on hold) and the person I spoke with said the part was too large to ship and that I would have to return the bad part to the store and they would open the box so I could get the correct part out. Part being the side of the wardrobe, requires my truck to transport. At this point I was infuriated. I called the Merriam Kansas store to verify that they had the wardrobe in stock and drove (2.5 hours) to the store bringing the bad part in. I explained the issue to the customer service rep and she said it would be a few minutes for some one to bring the box down. 35 minutes later, I asked about it and she disappeared then returned with the 2 boxes. I explained that the part was in the large box and removed the smaller one from on top of it. She starts cutting the box open with a standard box knife, which, since the package says, no cutting (picture of a box knife with a circle with a line through it) I assumed she knew what she was doing. Nope. Put cut marks on the outside side of the wardrobe part. I was extremely upset, didn't say anything except, 'oh, you cut my part'. She offered to get yet another box down. At that point I took the part and left. I decided I would switch places with the other unit and the side with the cut would be against the wall.
SO, I will NEVER buy anything from Ikea again and suggest NO ONE else does either. Furniture quality is 'OK' (3 out of 5) Service is EXTREMELY incompetent and I am out an extra $100.00 because of 2 extra trips to the store that I should not have had to make.",Trustpilot_USA
"Never Ever Again . My first experience at IKEA will be my last. Saturday, March 20, 2021, I drove an hour and a half from my home to IKEA. I was so excited for my first time, as I am a huge lover of interior design and home decor. I went in after some research looking for some clear dining chairs. I fell in love with the TOBIAS chair and had my mind set on getting them. I looked on the website that morning to confirm they were in stock before my drive. After walking through the showroom and grabbing some additional cute things, I went to go and grab the chairs. I find the aisle and bin only to find bottoms and not the tops. I look around to make sure they weren't misplaced and go and ask a team member for help. I looked again on the website, where it showed there was still availability for them. He looks at his tablet and it shows inventory on the chairs are 14. He walks me down the aisle and says, someone might have bought them and forgotten the bottoms that more chairs would be in on Monday. Disappointed, I returned to the showroom to see if any other chairs would work. I saw about 6-7 of the clear TOBIAS chairs on the floor and thought I would ask another team member if those can be sold since I made such a far drive. Again, to my disappointment, floor models cannot be sold unless they are discontinued. She said they can be ordered and shipped to my house, to go back to the self-serve warehouse and have someone build an order for them. I spoke with a manager, who waived the delivery fee, and said I can come pick them up the next day, Sunday, at the store, that they were getting another shipment. So, one person told me Monday, another told me Sunday, the website shows availability on the chairs, and the inventory on the team members tablet showed availability as well. There is so much inconsistency. So, I go ahead and have the team member order the chairs for me to ship to my house since it was a far drive for me. The team member guaranteed the chairs would be delivered by Monday. I hadn't checked my email until Monday morning, to see an email from IKEA, excited, hoping it was shipping details. No, it's an email from SATURDAY, the day I put in the order, stating they are out of stock. The day the team member ordered them for me. So easily my money was taken but they weren't even available. AND to this day, I’m still waiting for them to return my money for them. I am appalled, disappointed and so unsatisfied with my experience with this company.

I have called 6 times to get updates and the only 2 emails I received for the order confirmation and to let me I was getting my partial delivery which I actually thought was going to be complete. The phone agents have been very pleasant though.

I can’t believe how little effort they put into keeping you updated. Everything I have found out about this order has been because I had to call and ask. I have even been on hold for more than 45 minutes on one call, when my situation was escalated. I hung up eventually.

I think on top of my disappointment, I am also surprised because being that the situation in retail in so dire,I would think a company would try to hold on to every customer they have. Even the phone greeting for customer service tells you that they most likely won’t be able to help you.

Online information said phones were answered until 20h00, but at 18h15 a recorded message said phone lines were closed. The frustration is astounding, deliberate and the whole process is unhelpful.

3/17- delivery of everything except table top. Was told it would be delivered on 3/19. Husband requested refund of delivery charges. Case was opened.
3/19- no delivery came. Called ikea 2 times- (1 hour, 4 min) was told NO delivery is in the system for me. Asked for refund of tabletop and also mentioned delivery refund. Got hung up on!

3/21- drove another 2 hours to ikea to pick up tabletop so daughter could use desk. Purchased another tabletop

3/21- called ikea 2 times (1 hour on phone) Told that my delivery refund was sent to a manager for approval (which was just a technicality) and I would receive refund soon. Got hung up on halfway thru phone call- didn't receive call back.

3/24- delivery from ikea shows up with no notice. Rejected- thank God I was outside and saw them- otherwise I would have 2 tabletops and 2 charges.

3/27- called ikea- (55 minutes) mostly on hold. Checking on refunds- got hung up on again during transfer to yet another department.

3/28- called back- on hold for 25 minutes. Had to hang up to handle other responsibilities

3/30- (2 hours and 58 minutes)- spoke to marlene- gave me case numbers and directed me to the resolution team. Spoke with bill- no refund for delivery issued. Would receive a call back from charlotte store within 24-48 hours. Never received phone call.

2) So we ordered other things and decided to call. First manager told us ""oh, yeah I can make an order for this couch, it will be delivered in about two weeks"" and sent an e-mail with the bill. We payed, but then received the second email ""wasn't paid, try again"". We call AGAIN (FYI, every call you wait AT LEAST AN HOUR AND A HALF on the line). Another manager told that ""sorry bla bla bla.... we can try to order again, the delivery will be in ONE MONTH"", explaining that there is a long list for delivery service!!!!! WHAT?????? One day ago it was two weeks. We asked can we just pick it up in the store, she said NO ""because the store (in Miami) and IKEA storage have different locations. FML!!!!!
3) In the store, in Miami (1801 NW 117th Ave, Miami, FL) a manager explains that they don't have one part of the couch in the store, that's why we couldn’t order online pick up service. WHY do they basically show an item if you can not buy it????
When we ordered other stuff using the same manager helping, the bill that he gave me wasn't able to be paid, and we were walking back and forth from one manager to another waisting our time!
About the couch, they suggested to come in a few days to check maybe they will have it.....
4) FINALLY we ordered online having a delivery in three weeks. Today is supposed to be the delivery day. At the website zero information on WHEN it will be delivered and zero contact from ikea on the day of delivery or in advance of this date. We called AGAIN just to know at least a time window.

So, I called them and they told me that they would take charge of my request for annulment of the return and they started the replacement request. On the canceled day set for the return, 2 guys came to my place for taking the sofa back but I explained to them that it had been canceled, then I called the customer service of IKEA Netherlands that was not able, from March 8 (date of annulled pick up) to exchange the sofa. They told me to send them the pictures of the problem and explaining what was the problem with the sofa. After having sent the pictures I had to wait two weeks for the inquiry to be processed.

"Failure to deliver within their obligations and dreadful customer services . We ordered a Superking mattress and paid £50 for 'express delivery'. We were given a delivery time on a Saturday between 7am-7pm. We tracked the delivery and could see the vehicle was about 7 miles from us. a couple of hours past and nothing arrived. The message we got when we checked the tracking again was 'we are unable to deliver your item' We tried to get through to customer service but to no avail. The following day after holding for 40 minutes we finally got through to then be cut off! Called again another 30 mins on hold and finally got through to a customer services representative. We were told 'they had not got the correct item on the lorry', we asked 'why we had not had confirmation of this and were shocked when they said 'they would not have contacted us and it was up to us to contact them!!'. If this wasn't bad enough, they refused to refund the £50 we had paid for 'express delivery' and offered us a £10 gift voucher!!! We appreciate things go wrong but to refuse to refund the 'express delivery charge' when it was their fault is absolutely outrageous. Vey little in a way of apology and the represented said we would have to wait another week for delivery.
We will be looking at Ikea's legal obligations under their 'express delivery' contract to assess any liability, but all it would have taken was a 'we are really sorry for your inconvenience' and 'we will of course refund you as it was our fault'.
A real shame as Ikea offer excellent products but badly let down by their dreadful customer care!",Trustpilot_USA

I took the photo for a malm dresser’s tag (actually didn’t Understand some notes in that excepted price). I had other dresses that I saw online, and I showed to a staff in there to ask how I could have that items. He gave me a map and wrote down the note about area that I could find them. I asked him wrote down the area for a malm dresser also, but he refused, he said that I had it in my phone (the malm dresser’s tag photo). And he repeated the same sentence when I asked him again. What is the heck’s service? I went to shopping with 2 kids, 1 hand for stroller, 1 hand for his map and hand for my phone and eyes on my kids? That’s the way Ikea treat customer?

I left a message at the corporate (USA) office - the recording says I will hear back within 24 hours. Let's see.

Since the start of lockdown, we decided we wanted a new kitchen.
We went on to the online planner and planned it all. It was easy to use, but was quite sensitive (when moving a cupboard, it would jump somewhere else)
We then booked an appointment with a planner, and they called.
They logged into our account to make sure we'd done it all correctly (there were a few things we needed to change)
We agreed that we wanted to go ahead with the kitchen.
The planner sent me an invoice which I paid online.
The delivery date was agreed, and the delivery company came to drop it off.

"Bad service all around . So I ended up buying a fridge from ikea Thursday evening. I called in as it’s a big purchase and didn’t want anything to go wrong by me making any kind of mistake by doing an online purchase.
Delivery was set the next day between 9am-1pm.

Friday rolls around, drivers get to my house. They inform me that they cannot go into my house to bring the fridge inside, just the platform right inside of the door.

I was furious as I just needed it to go 3 steps of stairs, which I cannot do myself or have the equipment for.

I instantly called ikea to cancel my order as I still needed a fridge since the food was spoiling.

The guy I spoke to said he gets it, and based on our conversation, they have had numerous complaints as he states “it’s at the point where I just process the paperwork.”

I later receive a call from ikea that I missed as I was still working (from home). When I called them back, they needed to confirm the refund.

I informed her that I had already called previously to do so. Resulting in me being quite upset of having to deal with them so many times.

Then I found out that it’s a 7-10 business day processing time for the refund, which I find absolutely rediculous.

My fridge stopped working the day before I called and made the order.
I need a fridge, and I have to wait another 2 weeks to get my refund and buy another fridge? That is unacceptable as there were no disclaimers regarding no entering of my house for Covid purposes, and no disclaimer for the refund policy.

Furthermore, the drivers were dishonest as the notes on file stated that it didn’t fit in my doorway. Not because they didn’t want to enter my house.
They took out a measuring tape and took a picture. They didn’t even take the fridge out of the truck.

Today, Sunday, I receive ANOTHER call from ikea to reschedule the delivery.
Like, really? After all that, they still haven’t cancelled my order?

They lack communication to their customers and don’t seem to care. After having to talk with them NUMEROUS times regarding the same issue of simply cancelling my order.",Trustpilot_USA

"Totally Disappointed in this Experience . I wish I'd read these reviews before spending over $15,000 on a kitchen from Ikea. I'm so exhausted after this experience....sitting here in tears and thought I'd warn others.
How do they get away with treating their customers like complete garbage?
1. First, they nickel and dime you for every single item. That translates into multiple deliveries and an entire garage full of individual boxes.
2. They insist you inventory every item before you make an appointment for installation. No one explained this process at all. It took me plus 4 of my neighbors 3 hours to complete the items inventory.
3. I ended up making 4 trips back to the store for missing or out-of-stock items. They charged me for more items than I needed, Other items that were needed they never include.
4. The installation happened in the 2 days promised time however they charged for every single extra cut they made to the sum of over $500.
Every trip made to the store was one frustration after another with absolutely no help from store associates. At the end of the day, if you're considering a large purchase you could spend the same amount at a well-respected company that cares about their customers and appreciate their business.",Trustpilot_USA

I had to email a photo of the broken item. Was told I would get a full refund. Checked online and was only issued a refund for the item cost, not the shipping cost. So I had to call again - waited on hold yet again - and then the customer service agent couldn’t open the software for 10 minutes. She then told me IKEA doesn't refund shipping costs - even for damaged items! I told her that’s unacceptable - why should I pay for their mistakes and products that break? Then the call was cut off. So then I had to call AGAIN. Was told that IKEA phone calls are internet based and the connection often doesn’t work. And then I was transferred to yet another person - even more time on hold.

This is terrible service and I can't believe I paid £40 service delivery charge for this. It's going on the next bonfire, at least I'll get more use out of it that way.

I will never be using Ikea ever again.

FYI - If you want a storage unit without having to pay for service delivery charge try Argos, they have some great furniture on there right now and next day delivery. - Wished I knew this before wasting my money on bloody Ikea.",Trustpilot_USA

I have sat on the phone for ages listening to ABBA (guess it could have been worse) and asking me to be respectful to their staff when I got to speak to them which was never. I live in Northern Ireland and to visit our IKEA shop would break Covid rules and as I haven't been in a shop for almost a year now that's not going to happen. so I am appalled that individuals like myself are being penalised in this way.

Furniture that is more suited to a show home than a real home! . Have used Ikea many times and each time the experience gets worse. The products get cheaper feeling in quality and the staff less helpful. First time the delivery date was missed multiple times. Had to cancel and reorder. The delivery guys were complaining about the weight of the products I ordered and threatened to not bring it to my door! Most recently I ordered a Malm desk with the pull out part. Forgot how fragile the surface is. Any thing hard falling from a small height will cause damage. The foil construction is lightweight but also lightweight in sturdiness with a maximum 50kg load weight.

"No will or action from IKEA to correct their own mistakes . Two Unresolved orders over the last week.

Order 1: Wardrobe was sent with missing parts and was damaged. Customer services offered me £6 compensation on a £480 wardrobe. The delivery men knew the box was torn open and didn't check to see if any parts were missing before delivering. I had a handyman in that afternoon, and had to go buy the missing parts from Leylands... yet to be reimbursed for those missing parts. Had to ask Customer service to call the driver, to see if parts was still in delivery lorry. No proactive action taken; just reading out the T&Cs to me. Not customer service fault, but would be nice if they tried to solve the issue.

Order 2: Pay £50 for ""named delivery day""; not delivered and not in contact (even though email states that they will be in contact if any delays). Call on 3 separate occasions, only get through to Customer Services on 3rd attempt (total of over 3 hours on the phone). Customer service let me know that part of the sofa is missing. If I hadn't called they wouldn't have been in touch, and would have let order slide. Reimburse £20 of £50 delivery charge... why not the full amount? Seems bizarre.

Is the intention of withholding all this information until the last moment, that people will be too fed up to cancel and will simply accept such a dreadful mark up on the otherwise antipated cost of the goods.

We talked to customer service to return it. However, as the stores are closed, we cannot return them. We can only ship with fedex by courier. However, I had to pay for the shipping. Total nonsense !!! they send a product that smells disgusting, but I have to pay for their error. This is not about liking it or not, it will be a refund entirely due to the fault of the seller. Also, I do not understand why I am returning a product I bought online from the store. Their stores are also closed.

Bought this FRIHETEN sofa two years back and one day while lifting myself up I push down the side panel/arm rest down a bit and it collapsed vertically inwards. After calling ikea they told me a private company known as ecomaster will do inspection, a random incompetent person turned up after few days and took just some photos, kept asking how old is this sofa, and went out the door straight without saying what he think not even asking if how that happened.
He went back reported ikea that this is accidental and unsurprisingly ikea emailed me that they will do nothing hence the guarantee went down the drain. Well thank you ikea for losing a customer.

Pathetic after sales service. They gave me wrong items because of which I was unable to complete assembly of my bed. Now I am stuck with incomplete bed since 7 days and they have not issued refund. After repeated emails and calls also they don't bother to give resolution because they have already collected money from me. Now they don't care if I received the correct order or not.

"Exceptionally bad service has been par… . Exceptionally bad service has been par for the course for me at Ikea for several years now. I've had orders canceled without knowledge of the fact they were canceled, waiting like a chump on hold for hours on end trying to sort things out. Requesting supervisor intervention, being told they will call me back followed be an email that supervisors are too busy to talk to the likes of me with my little concern.
Yesterday was like any other Ikea customer service experience I've had. After waiting in a long return line a week ago to return an item purchased during a lockdown, I did not have the exact method of payment with me. I was told that they will put it on a gift card and that so I didn't have to wait in the long line again that I could just go to any checkout till and get the gift card placed on my original method of payment. Ha, suckered again!!! Went to a checkout till to attempt what I was told I could do just a short week ago and was very abruptly told no. Requested a supervisor, was told no. Requested the customer service supervisor to discuss the error that will now take even more time from my day, was told they were too busy. I informed the supervisor, that I would wait for the store manager to discuss. The store manager comes over with the so typical puffed-out chest syndrome to tell me the same thing. I requested that he assist me in performing the buyback of the gift card that I never wanted to begin with and he told me that I should wait in the hour-long line again!!! Naturally, I asked to speak to his boss, and he told me that he was the boss. I asked him, four times over if he was the boss of the store and if there was any above him I could speak with. He told me, that he was as high as there was... right now. So I dumbed it down for him asking him if there was a flow chart of Ikea and look at a flow chart for this store with the hierarchy, you would be at the top every day of the week? Finally, he conceded and told me he did indeed have a boss. I will call the store today, I'm sure to waste my breath and time as I will not get through to his majesty, and even if I could be told to screw off anyway.

"Criminally Bad Service - weeks of chasing for my refund for an order THEY cancelled and STILL haven't received it!! . The WORST experience I've ever had of any retailer in my life. Spent £496 on furniture, including £40 for an allocated delivery slot, then never heard anything from them again. After several weeks of waiting, spent an hour on the phone listening to ABBA on loop, to find out what was going on - only to be told the order had been cancelled by them without explanation; and no one had even thought we might like to be told this. Was promised a refund. Nothing materialised. Called again after a week and a half, was told the refund would be in our account 3 days later. Nothing materialised. Called them again and was told we were being fast tracked for a refund, would receive it in 5 days. Nothing materialised. Called them again after two weeks. Got about five seconds into the call and got cut off. Called them again, was put on hold while they ""read my case notes"", was on hold for half an hour. Each 5 calls meant 5 hours of listening to ABBA, fed lies, lies, lies, mixed with unending incompetence, AND they're still holding onto £496 of my money. Beyond furious.

This is criminally negligent service and I have now been forced to threaten IKEA with legal action to recover my monies that they are illegally withholding.

"Poor quality, meaningless warranties & horrible customer service . I purchased a mattress from the Amsterdam location of Ikea in 2018. We went for the slightly higher-end HOKASSEN model, which cost us around €500. After just two years, one side of the mattress started caving in - it appears the layer of foam around the mattress has separated from the core. I contacted Ikea's customer service team about this issue, as their website claims all mattresses come with a 25-year warranty.

After weeks of slow communication and lots of back-and-forth with the customer service team on Facebook messenger, they finally connected me to the claims team. They then asked for additional information and photos, only to then reply back saying: ""We have started to process your enquiry and have thoroughly examined your photos. Considering this information, we have concluded that the damage stated is caused by circumstances that lie outside the product itself, e.g. daily use, impacts from dropping or falling, or incorrect use of the product.""

So apparently ""daily use"" is considered a legitimate reason to void the warranty, even though the Terms and Conditions say nothing of the sort. According to the T&C: ""The claim must not be the result of incorrect use of the product, such as dropping it, knocking it over, using it for a purpose other than that for which it was intended, not maintaining it properly, or having it repaired by a third party.""

I replied with this information and asked for further explanation from the services team and never received a reply. So after over a month of emailing about the damage with my mattress, I end up ghosted by Ikea. One of the worst customer service experiences I've ever had.

For anyone thinking about buying a mattress from Ikea, be warned -- the mattresses are not made to last and the warranty is worth nothing more than the paper it's printed on.",Trustpilot_USA

"Not worth it. Go buy real furniture. . We bought a SEKTION with all the drawers that go with it. Everything was fine until the last step of putting the doors on. The top hinge wont fit because of a manufacturing defect. So we spent the last two hours putting this together and now the door wont shut correctly. Do you think you're NASA with your fit tolerances? Do you think you're selling rockets to the moon? There is about an 1/8"" space the hinge needs and slip in, and there is about 1/32"" of a gap for it to fit.

"Not even worth 1 star . It's a shame i have to give one star really as I don't think they even deserve that. I ordered some furniture for delivery and paid the £50 fee which, according to their customer service who I had to wait on hold for 45 minutes to speak to after my stuff didn't show up, is not to book a delivery. I always assumed that when I paid for a product called a delivery i was paying for an item to be delivered to me but according to ikea that is not the case, just what the £50 fee is for then, i still have no idea.

The customer service representative i spoke to was one of the rudest and most belligerent people I have ever had the misfortune of speaking to. Taking pleasure in making customers cry is apparently their main job as it definitely wasn't to find a solution to the fact my items ""were never put on the truck"". He refused multiple requests from me to be passed over to another customer service rep and told me that if I insisted he would simply hang up the call. After 45 minutes of listening to the atrocity that is Abba compressed to play through a phone line, you can understand why that made me even more upset. He also informed he was the only one who handled complaints and that he was refusing to put in my complaint. This was, of course, a lie. I eventually managed to convince him to rebook my delivery for a few days later but on ending the call, he simply cancelled the entire order instead.

I then got to spend even more time on hold to speak to another customer service representative who did manage rebook my delivery but it really makes you question just the kind of business ikea is running where these are the kind of people representing their business.

I still received no details about my deliver and even after a call at 6pm the night before the second attempt the customer services could not confirm my items would arrive the next day. They did eventually arrive but with zero information from ikea.

In total that weekend i spent over two hours on hold waiting for ikea customer service, I assume this is down to the sheer number of people they have failed who are calling to try and get what they have paid for.

I am nothing but disgusted with the way ikea have handled my business and will not be using them in the future and I suggest you do not either. I have made multiple complaints and am yet to receive an apology, although they did eventually refund my £50 not-delivery fee.",Trustpilot_USA
"Do not order an IKEA dishwasher . I ordered a Finputsad dishwasher (""which?"" gave it good reviews). They didn't deliver when they said they would, but did deliver a few days later.

When it arrived, some of the parts (the door attachment brackets) were faulty. I contacted customer services to try to get some spares, but they don't stock spares for their dishwashers! They messed me around for a week: The first customer service person I spoke to arranged for a whole replacement dishwasher to be delivered, with a note attached that they were only meant to deliver the loose parts. This order was later mysteriously cancelled without informing me. When I noticed that the order was cancelled, I contacted customer services again. This time they told me, after searching around for a bit, that the dishwasher was manufactured by whirlpool, and that I should contact whirlpool directly for spare parts.

I phoned whirlpool on the number they gave me, and they told me they don't know anything about the dishwasher in question and don't recognise any of the numbers I read out from the service sticker.

I phoned IKEA again. This time they said they would contact whirlpool themselves and get them to contact me once they'd worked things out (Still not what I actually want: I just wanted some replacement parts, not to chat to a whirlpool employee).

At this point, I was really regretting ordering this dishwasher. Even assuming they managed to rectify the original order, who wants a dishwasher where the manufacturer denies it exists and nobody sells spare parts for it? I phoned IKEA back to request to return it. They tried to charge me a £25 collection fee to pick it up. According to them, a faulty dishwasher is classed as, ""customer changed their mind"", unless whirlpool have first visited and tried to fix it (which they aren't going to do because they don't believe it exists).

If you're looking for a dishwasher, I would look for a reputable brand who support their products and sell spares, not a reseller like IKEA.

If you're looking for anything else, I would still suggest avoiding IKEA, as ordering and arranging delivery was a horrible nightmare.",Trustpilot_USA

You pay for delivery and they wont… . You pay for delivery and they wont deliver it to the room of your choice? It says that you will initially then changes its tone further down in small print. A female is now stuck with furniture downstairs with packages she can not carry up the stairs. You issue masks you have two households working in the same delivery van but they can not delivery to a room upstairs to a house that isn't even lived in yet. If we knew this when we ordered we would of gone somewhere else for overpriced chipboard. absolutely shocking rude drivers. Stop using the pandemic for an excuse there are controls in place for all industries sort yourselves out. Im a safety consultant who deals with COVID-19 controls so I know this is just a cop out.

"Disaster Kitchen Process . We began our Ikea kitchen design last October and it is now mid February. After purchasing the parts needed to build our kitchen, we have been met with a series of errors and crappy compromises. First off, we have an average sized kitchen and ordered basic cabinets and they still never got the order straight. We paid $79 for an official measurement and that measurement was incorrect. The excuse was new staff.... After 3 deliveries of random goods, delivered to the sidewalk in front of our house, we also had to go buy more parts and return wrong parts 9 times within a month and a half. All during a Global pandemic and no phone payments or orders taken. We had to travel south 40 minutes each time, go into the corn maze and pay and then drive 5 more miles east to their warehouse for pick up. Our final plan shows the upper cabinets going to the ceiling but when they were building it out we were told that was not an option/not part of the plan? We used Traemand because supposedly they know how to build Ikea designs but they proved to be a huge disappointment and were a integral part of the confusion with all the conflicting parts we ended up with.
The final straw was that they built one whole side of our kitchen incorrectly. We could not open our fridge because the wall oven and microwave area was too close to the fridge door. Keep in mind we gave the Ikea designers and Traemand all appliance cut out dimensions in the design and build phase. The only resolution Ikea had was to have Traemand move our cabinets on that wall 2 inches to the right. This required that our countertop on that side be removed. American Marble works in conjunction with Ikea kitchens so we used them. Ikea would not agree to anything unless we came into the store once again and pay an additional $1300 dollars for a new countertop, in the event they could not use the original one. What could we do? we were stuck with appliances that could not be installed! We paid thinking they could reuse the piece since it was a simple cut that only needed to be shortened 2 inches on one side. Traemand came back out and all fits somewhat but the appliances still look crowded on that side so not aesthetically pleasing. While waiting for American Marble to reinstall, they took forever to get back to us, insisted on a $225 measure appointment for that minor adjustment that could have been done on site. When I finally called and asked what the delay was they said the countertop for that side needed to be remade and it would be another 2 weeks. At this point I lost it. I questioned why they needed to replace that piece and they said they didn't know (I'm just a scheduler). I guess it's easy to just press that button and buy when the expense is on another person. After sending a nasty email to the trio (Ikea, Traemand and America Marble), I was told by American Marble that they could actually reuse that countertop piece after all. Still 2 weeks to wait for a half hour install. I still haven't gotten a response from Ikea. Also, the Traemand carpenters had to Jerry rig an area on that messed up side so when Best Buy came to install the wall oven and microwave with trim kit, no go. It doesn't fit. Traemand excuse was we didn't use Ikea appliances. Funny appliances are all standard sizes and we weren't told any of that when we gave them the cut out dimensions over 3 months ago. We since hired a Task Rabbit to come and resolve their screw up. I can't wait to have to go back into Ikea and try to get a refund for that additional countertop we paid for, The moral of this long story is you get what you pay for! I chose Ikea because I love the modern look and the price seemed good. In the end, it would have been better to see out a more professional, quality cabinet designer and builder. God knows what I will be paying for therapy and blood pressure medication in the future!",Trustpilot_USA
"Hopeless system - failed purchase . Ordered Friday for collection 2-8pm Saturday. Saturday came & went with no notification. Email DID arrive on Sunday afternoon - after the store had closed. Went along Monday evening, rang the designated number, entered order number, received text confirming ""please wait til we text you"". After an hour went to talk to assistant - who called indoors. Our order had been cancelled because we hadn't collected during the ordered time. ""But you didn't tell us it was ready until the following day, after the store had closed."" Order had apparently been cancelled & we would be refunded 3-5 working days later. IKEA's systems are hopeless. Cancelling an order because we didn't collect it even though they didn't tell us it was ready until the following day is worse than useless. Texting us when we'd called on arrival to tell us to wait (when they'd already cancelled the order!) is even more worse than useless. Don't bother with IKEA during lockdown, people.",Trustpilot_USA

No way on web site to send email asking for info and when I tried to ring I gave up after 25 minutes.

"today I had the absolute worst customer… . today I had the absolute worst customer service I have ever experienced in my life. I'll start at the beginning...we just built a house and need to furnish it- spent a few hundred bucks last week on 2 pax wardrobes and a dresser- purchased them online. We liked the product so I decided to go buy a unit that would cover my master bedroom wall. Did my research online and went into the store to confirm my ideas and to buy it to bring it home. Talked to the 2 sales girls, one was totally not interested and brushed me off to someone else. The second sales girl talked me out of a wardrobe system and suggested i buy a living room set instead, it had drawers and it would leave an open space for our bedroom tv. I told her the most important thing was to be sure it was on site as I have very limited time and I needed my crew to build and furnish 5 bedrooms, a living room and a rec. room within 7 days before I go back to work. I needed to get it there asap and didn't have time to waste. After going with her recommendation and assurances all items were downstairs and there was ample stock, I left to go get it. Surprize surprize, many of the framework wasn't even in stock. Changed it all to white instead of black and after getting those carts filled, they too were short on stock, one frame, 13 drawers and 2 doors. After 7 hours, and starving (was supposed to only be an hour- 2 max, I started loosing it and spoke with a lovely manager who was very helpful but it was still a mess as now I had to come back tomorrow to get another frame and had to get a delivery of the rest of the items march 4th. Extremely upset and starving, I was so frazzled, I put the incorrect pin in for my card (was the only card I had brought) My bank is over an hour away and it was not 830pm so I was unable to go to the bank to fix my card and make it back to the store in time. My phone was out of power and I was incredibly stressed out. I asked the manager to please not put my stuff away and explained what happened and that I would be back first thing in the morning to pay for it without any issues. The bill was just shy of 1800. which I was very happy with, but it was 4 carts and took hours and hours to get together let alone the stress I endured getting it together. She had the audacity to complain that she had been working for 13 hours and she absolutely refused to keep my order together for me. I asked her just to hold it (not put it away) as It took me soo long to gather it and she said NO! She knew what I went through to gather it all (I explained it to her) and she still said NO! I am disgusted and absolutely IRATE! How could you possibly treat your customers that way after what you put me through in order to get it! HOW COULD YOU!!! Ikea, you don't deserve good/loyal customers! I glad I discovered how awful you truly are before i furnished my whole house. I would like to hear how you could possibly justify the way you treated me. Shame on you! Please respond",Trustpilot_USA

Phone call at 14:25 from delivery truck to say they would be there within the hour. Another phone call at 15:08 to say they'd be 5 minutes.

Then just after that, two lovely men from the Gateshead Ikea store came to deliver all our items. Nothing missing from 40+ items from different departments.

Glad I took the risk to order, given the recent slew of bad reviews.

I phoned the helpline, was on hold for nearly an hour, then a very helpful lady processed the cancellation for me and a refund was issued. I reordered the items online, this time for home delivery. The package arrived today and it was missing two items, though they were listed as enclosed on the packing list. I phoned the helpline again, on hold for 20 minutes, and another very helpful person arranged for delivery of the missing things. They should arrive next week.

"Ikea charging customers and not delivering for months . I know that there are many posts on the topic but I want to share my experience and warn people. I am placed in New York City. I had read about Ikea problems in the US, but I foolish thought that in January 2021things would be better. I was wrong.

I placed an order for 4 items (Finnala couch and Ottoman, Micke desk, and wall mirrror) on January 20, 2021. It took me weeks to manage and place this order as before everything was out of stock. Delivery date was February 22, 2021. A long time, but I decided to go for it. Yesterday, suddenly the delivery date was changed to March 22, 2021. An entire month later. I contacted them through the phone. Hours only to be given contradictory information. I talked to a manager that basically blamed everything and anything in the world as not to explain what really was going on. Today, the delivery date was changed again to APRIL. I called them again. Frustrating phone call where the ""manager"" I talked to dared to be very disrespectful. Again, no answers. They keep saying they know nothing and there is nothing they can do as if it is normal to charge people and then not deliver the merchandise. I could explain in more details the conversation with them, but I feel drained.

These are hard times for everyone. It is hard to find the money to place these orders so that we can at least be comfortable in the apts we are stuck in. Ikea fraudulently sells items they do not have and keeps their customers' money for months, and know they can get away with it because they are this global potency. Then, they blame their failure on ""things being hard"", like they are your local bakery. This company is disgusting and I wish I had the resources or peace of mind to actually take action against them.

Please be aware that even if items are said to be in stock and you pay for them and a delivery date is set, they actually don't know if they have those items and the delivery date will keep being changed, month after month.",Trustpilot_USA

The biggest waste of my time in the world. And so frustrating with trying to schedule when to be home so they don't leave my package on the streets of NY. Doesn't matter though, BECAUSE IT WILL NEVER SHOW UP.

Customer service told me 1] it's in stock at all of the three Ikeas around me. 2] They have no idea why it hasn't been delivered. 3] They can't confirm anything. 4] And then she got sassy with me when I was trying to be extremely calm.

EVEN WHEN I GOT A CONFIRMATION CALL THEY MOVED THE ESTIMATED DELIVERY BY A MONTH. ORDER ANYWHERE ELSE.

An order form the beginning of December takes for ever to receive us, I can understand this due to the fact of the lockdown and everybody is ordering online at your place. But then a item is missing, can also happen but what happens after that is really bad. Responses on support request take for ever and days go by with out a reply. Finally the missing product is shipped, another month goes by (By now you should have sorted things out) and even this is worse, it should have arrived the 4th of feb. But I only got it today. This means I have waited for over 2 months to get my full order and what even makes it worse is the your service really sucks. Sorry for the words but I can understand the logistics hassle from selling almost everything offline to online but what I can not understand is the lack in service and response.

after several calls with customer service that confirmed it was on the way, a week later I got confirmation my order was cancelled.

"Kitchen Nightmare . Via the website, I ordered a kitchen on 18th Jan, and was unable to select a delivery date, I was auto-assigned 9th Feb.

I changed the delivery date from 9th to 11th Feb using the website the day after I placed the order.

On the 8th Feb, I got a text from DPD saying my Ikea delivery would be made tomorrow. I called Ikea and after 20mins on hold with ABBA, I spoke to Emilia who informed me that there was an error and they were not delivering on the 9th but also not able to deliver on the 11th either. I was instead allocated a delivery date of the 12th.

Without telling me, Ikea then changed the delivery date to the 14th. Unfortunately, the 3 men who are fitting the kitchen are starting on the 13th.

I shall not be using Ikea again and would strongly recommend that everyone else avoids Ikea at all costs.",Trustpilot_USA

"Threatening letters because of a refund!? . I purchased my kitchen from IKEA Berlin last year. Two items from the order were missing, but I was able to replace them at Bauhaus, so I asked IKEA for a refund. I never heard back from them. After 2 months of replies without any response, I filed a claim through PayPal (which I had used to make the order) with full documentation. PayPal completed the refund on IKEA's behalf. (It was about €100.)

In January, I received a written demand from IKEA that I pay them the money I was refunded. I emailed IKEA and PayPal about this. IKEA told me to ignore the letter as they had made a mistake. Today, I received a second demand threatening me with legal action if I do not transfer the ~€100 to their bank immediately.

I have no idea what to do as clearly one department is not talking to another. I'll give them 2 stars in lieu of 1 because the quality of IKEA products is at least reliable and consistent, and because I know that 2-star reviews are taken more seriously than 1-star reviews. But this situation is unbelievable. I had a €120 gift card for IKEA and I'm tempted to tell them to take the gift card value as ""payment"" because I will not be shopping with them again.",Trustpilot_USA

The representative I spoke to earlier today at NAL assured me that it is their policy to call when the van is 30-40 minutes away and then again at 5 minutes. In sync with my prior terrible NAL experience, I got ONLY the 5 minute call in which the driver told me he ""could not wait"".

"Someone needs to file a class action suit… . Someone really needs to file a class action suit related to IKEA's practices that are designed to make it hard to get your money back.

Here is my experience. I order $3000 worth of kitchen cabinets some from store inventory and most from warehouse. The warehouse delivers but the store cancels my store order. No notification, I just learn this from contractor who alerts me that items were never delivered. He tells me store order cancelled by IKEA.
Here's the outrageous part and where a class action suit could be successful. IKEA does not credit my card when THEY cancel. No. They make me wait on the phone for an hour and ten minutes to get to a rep who then develops a case number for ""request for refund"" and says it may get processed in a few days.
Sorry but if a store -- not the customer -- cancels and order it has an obligation to immediately charge back the card. It is totally unreasonable to expect the customer to have to fix this overcharge issue. In my case it was over 500 bucks so I waited and pursued. Many smaller purchasers likely do not bother.
My guess is that many people do not ever get their refunds given the hassle of having to chase for it. Hence their is likely a class of people who have been screwed. Lawyers... there is an opportunity here I am quite sure.",Trustpilot_USA

Tracking on their website says it is ""in treatment"". Although a Post NL tracking number is available, Post NL has not received it for delivery.
Nobody answers the phone of twitter DMs.

I just want to know when I can expect to receive it. Being kept in the dark is not nice. I can accept delays, I can accept everything, just don't keep me in the dark - especially now that people are able to buy and collect the very next day.

Once home I opened one and saw it was a matress cover. Was upset because I matched the number of the item to the number of what I thought were pillows in the rack while I was in the store. There were no sales persons about to help me know for sure what I was buying. So, today I went back to return these items and was told sorry, no we won't take it back because there is hair on the one that had been opened. I was surprised to hear that because something like that has never happened to me while returning something to a store. So I called customer service to see if I could get anywhere with them and was told by the representative to take the hair off using Scotch tape. I was dismayed by what he expected me to do and told him so! He then schooled me saying ""would you try to return clothes with hair on them?"" And he spoke over me while I was trying to talk. Now, had I purchased it online and returned it through the mail, there would have been no questions asked it would have been returned without an issue. Because I went to the store and the item was visualized by the clerk I was denied the return.

In store they said they’d be in stock on 1st December 2020 but they were not. I checked online every day and finally they were in stock on 1st January so I ordered and they took my money in full. They said they’d be delivered today 30th January 2021.

I then received a text message yesterday, 29th January 2021 to say my order would be delivered today between 11.30am and 4.30pm. It said on the order confirmation email that I would receive an update today to say between what hour it would come and I waited in all day for the delivery and no update from IKEA. I rang IKEA at the end of my four hour delivery window and was told it was ‘out for delivery’ but the delivery truck was delayed a further hour and they’d get them to ring me. I waited until 5.30pm and rang again to be told the items were not only, NOT out for delivery, but they are no longer in stock and she has no idea when they are coming back in stock and can’t even tell me when they will come. So they have my money but do I even have an order.

So they clearly send automated text messages to tell people of deliveries when they haven’t even processed the orders. They don’t then have the courtesy to tell customers the order wasn’t processed and isn’t being delivered, the contrary is true they send a text message with very specific delivery times. They then lied on the phone. Most professional delivery services can tell if things are out for delivery and communicate this to customers. Most companies don’t take money in full for out of stock items.

Was it even in stock when I ordered or did they allocate my items to someone else. Can they not update me by phone, email or text in the meantime (a month) to say they do not have the items.

Customer service the first time clearly lied and on the second call was unapologetic and cannot even give me a date when my items will be delivered. Someone may contact me by email when they get a chance she explained!!

Don’t hide behind covid for such poor communication and customer service.

"DREADFUL DREADFUL ONLINE SERVICE . As a commercial landlord I have recently spent over £700 with Ikea. Some of the order wasn't delivered and I had a dreadful job trying to obtain a refund, I spent an hour and a half trying to get through on the phone then they wanted to keep the delivery charge of £25 even though the order had been only part delivered. I eventually resolved this. Then foolishly ordered another lot of furniture with a lamp that has arrived today and the lamp is smashed. I CANNOT get through to Ikea at all. The phone line says 'sorry we are too busy at the moment' then cuts you off. There is no email complaints line so I cannot return this item. What do I do! I am tired of the endless trouble in dealing with this company.",Trustpilot_USA

Really disappointed with ikea customer… . Really disappointed with ikea customer service. I ordered a sofa online and within less than 24hrs I called to cancel that order and place a new order because I realized the dimensions of the original order wouldn’t fit the space. They canceled the original order and then charged me again for the new order. It’s been two weeks and I still haven’t received my refund for the first order which was over $700. I called the company to find out why it’s taking so long and the associate claimed that they only have one office to handle all of the claims from customers for the entire North America continent. She said my cousin hasn’t even begun to process! Should take 30 days before it’s even processed and then another week or so to see it in my account. What bs is that!? So upset and disappointed in their lack of care for their customers. No excuse for such a large multi million dollar company to be so slow.,Trustpilot_USA
"Yvonne O'Toole Ikea Dublin . Just had the most amazing service from Yvonne O'Toole at Ikea Dublin. Nothing easy in Covid-19 lockdown, so getting Ikea order together has been difficult due to availability and deliveries (has been on-going for 2+ months). Yvonne took over the case yesterday and came up with a slight change to the design which replaced parts which are unavailable with available parts. Design is almost exactly the same, no negative impact and the order/delivery problem is solved. On top of all that Yvonne is so chipper and helpful.

Missing packages . I made a large order online in the Netherlands and IKEA split the delivery into 2 separate deliveries; truck and parcel. They charge 49 euro for this delivery service. The pieces needed to build the furniture are split between the deliveries which are spread 3 weeks apart. When the parcel delivery was finally carried out the shipment was missing 2 packages also with pieces that are needed to build the furniture (delivered earlier by truck). The shipment was also missing some smaller orders and they have not issued any credit note for this. There is zero communication about the missing packages and they are unreachable via phone and facebook. This is the worse delivery experience I have ever had and as a result 3 weeks later I am still waiting for the pieces needed to assemble the furniture.,Trustpilot_USA

"Oh my god fam, you need to chill. . Towards the end of December I ordered a Hemnes bookcase and Hemnes Chest of Drawers for delivery for early January. Whilst I thought the £40 delivery was a little steep, I didn’t mind paying due to the current pandemic.

On 4th January (my delivery date), only the bookcase arrived. The delivery driver assured me this would be noted and the chest of drawers sent at a further date. Two days later I had still heard nothing and checked the website. It told me both items had been delivered. Every time I rang (after eventually finding the number) it told me the lines were too busy, no one responded to my Facebook post, my tweet or my emails. Eventually I got through to someone who explained that the system hadn’t been updated and they would resolve this. I was given a new delivery date for later that week.

On the new delivery date, only 2 out of the 3 boxes were delivered. Again the driver told me it would be resolved as the missing box was the one with the tools and instructions to build.

Again I had to try several times to contact somebody and when I got through they apologised and re-arranged delivery. The day came and went and nothing came. I rang back, they apologised again and arranged a new date. The day came and went and nothing came.

On ringing this time, I was getting a little tired of having two boxes in my house unable to do anything with them and being given false promises with no compensation.

The customer service person I spoke to informed me that the item was now fully out of stock, despite the website saying they had it in stock. He told me there was nothing I could do, I wasn’t entitled to compensation or a refund and I would just have to wait. When I told him this wasn’t acceptable his reply was “oh my god fam, you need to chill out”. To say I was wholly unimpressed with this disrespectful response is an understatement. I asked to speak to someone higher and he told me he could transfer me through but the managers never answered nor responded to complaints?!?

When I mentioned that I would also be asking for a copy of the recording of the call which IKEA so kindly inform customers take place, his tone changed completely.

However, two months later after the original booking I am still without the final box of the chest of drawers, out of pocket and without any form of compensation. Despite sending three formal complaint emails, I have heard nothing back from them.

Shocking from beginning to end. I would 100% recommend to not use their service as I found it to be absolutely shambolic and disrespectful.",Trustpilot_USA

Which was convenient for me as I was busy until the Friday.
Went on Friday and after a rigmarole of phoning a number and keying in my order number ( they never make it easy) surprise surprise my rug had been put back into stock and there was no way I could collect. Apparantly according to the admittedly apologetic member of staff you only have 24 hours to collect. She told me that it was stated on my order, except it’s not.
On the way back I had a text from ikea saying Thankyou for collecting your order! Of course there is no direct number to contact the store.
No refund either have just checked my account. They must think I’ve collected. Just rang customer services, it cut off as recorded message says they’re busy. No rug, 32 mile round trip and taken £30 from me and I’ve had a lot of frustration.

Collection was also a dream. They had well labelled separate parking space for Gumtree Customers and the collection was completed within 15minutes of us arriving there. Everything was done contactless as well.

I have read some of the reviews on here about items ordered being out of stock after payment had been taken and I understand how frustrating that might be but I will urge that we remain a bit understanding with them in the face of the Covid situation.

I will encourage you to check their Ikea Bargain Corner on Gumtree in your area as they only put items that are actually available up on there.

"Worst delivery and after sales service… . Worst delivery and after sales service from a big company Ikea Sweden.
Bought a daybed from Ikea SE and during assembly found some parts were missing. Contacted customer service and they place order for missing part on 13Dec 2020. No complaint registered why it happened. Even After numerous calls and visit to Ikea Malmo the parts have not been received and my bed is incomplete.Almost a month has passed and all they have to say everytime that its dispatched..dispatched.. dispatched. but not more than that.

"Avoid, especially if you're spending more than a few £. . Sadly, Ikea has seemingly changed, for the worse. The customer service is pretty much non-existent, in that you cannot reach anyone. The phone lines are closed 'due to high demand', you cannot speak to anyone online, and they don't have an email address. So, don't buy anything you cannot afford to write off.

I returned something worth £400 a month ago. No refund as yet, no contact from them, and I have literally no way of getting in touch. On the site they have a phone number but that doesn't work when you call it (and if you do get through it's an hour on hold), and their chat function is not always available, and when it is you get booted out of it 'by accident' so that you still cannot speak to anyone (again, minimum waiting time half an hour).

Much as I used to like Ikea, they are now off the list and I will use other vendors.",Trustpilot_USA
"More terrible customer service . Placed an order online on 17th October 2020 (1134698363) which has never arrived despite me chasing it up on 20th November and where it was allegedly resent out (91144259572), funnily enough this one has never arrived either.

As per The Consumer Rights Act 2015 section 28 (3) 'the trader must deliver the goods (a) without undue delay, and (b) and in any event, not more than 30 days after the day on which the contract is entered into.'
I have called your 'customer service' team on three occasions now and been on hold for over 30 minutes each time and each phone call has lasted over an hour so if your service is going to be this abysmal at least make this phone number a free one.

Your customer service is shocking, considering the fortune you have made through lockdown to offer the level of service you do is inexcusable.

I have put this through the Resolver process which you completely ignored and quite honestly I am now ready to take this to court for a refund of the order, compensation for my phone bills and court costs due to you breaching the law and me incurring these expenses.

I think waiting 3 months is more than adequate in a pandemic, especially in light of the fact I have made numerous attempts and several avenues to get this matter sorted without going down the legal route. Therefore your head office in Milton Keynes can expect the paperwork imminently.",Trustpilot_USA

We finally get it and bring it home to put it together and we’re missing the door hinges... we live an hour away and needed this armoir for clothes and now won’t have the hinges shipped for another week or so which means we’re going to have another week of our clothes being tossed wherever because we don’t have enough space.

"One star is too much for IKEA . One star is too much for IKEA, but it won't let me give zero.
I ordered a desk online as I need to work from home. Delivery option was an extra £40 for a delivery in 3 weeks time!
So, I opted for the click and collect option - which still cost an extra £5. Why you should have to pay to collect from the store is beyond me.
The nearest store is an hour away in London, but I needed it urgently so went for this option. I drove to the store only to be told there had been a mistake and the desk is out of stock.
This would have been OK - mistakes happen, but I then explained I had driven to London to collect it and to save me going back empty handed could they find another store in London that I could collect from. The answer was basically no, we don't help customers, you have to phone ""Customer Services"". So I sat in the car park and phoned their customer service number. After 40 minutes of being on hold listening to Christmas music (on January 7th!) I gave up and hung up.
I have been told I can have my money back in 4-5 days. Why 4-5 days? They took the money off me instantly, why can't they give it back instantly. So I now have the cost of a drive to London, a 40 minute phone call and half a day wasted and not even got my money back.
I tried to phone again when I got home to complain, but the ""customer service"" number now says it is not operating at this time due to high demand. i.e. there must be a lot of unhappy customers out there.",Trustpilot_USA
"Ikea Gumtree Bargain Corner makes no sense . Ikea Bargain Corner has just started putting items on Gumtree! My glass hob has just broken and I saw a bargain advertised on Gumtree that is at Ikea Greenwich. It's a bargain because it has a few scratches which are impossible to show in pictures.
I contacted them and they were a bit slow to respond by Gumtree standards.

What really annoyed me, though, is that they won't let me inspect the hob before purchase (as I could in a normal Bargain Corner) nor return it if I find the damage unacceptable.
HOW IS THIS SUPPOSED TO WORK?!

I thought I would speak to Customer Services but I have been trying to get through for days. Either I get the message that the service isn't available or I am on hold for half an hour only to be disconnected justwhen you think you are being transferred.

Pot arrived wrapped in one layer of bubble wrap, knocking around in a huge box, broken in pieces. Took pictures, attempted to contact IKEA. Phone numbers looped into ""We cannot take calls at this time due to high call volume, send us an email"" with no option to leave message. No options to file claim online that matched the situation; no email contacts available online that I could find.

Finally filed claim for other reason (""Cancel Order"") as I didn't know how else to get ahold of them.

Got an email in response a couple days later from US_CSC_Aftersales @ ikea.com asking for info that I'd already provided. Sent them the info they requested plus picture of how the item arrived. Then nothing. Emailed again in a week. Nothing. Emailed again weekly after that asking about refund status. Still nothing.

Ikea's customer service is terrible and I absolutely do not recommend. What a waste of money, on both the item and the ridiculously high shipping fees, all for a smashed item.

Here's the full email from Ikea, from email address US_CSC_Aftersales @ ikea.com :

We are sorry for any difficulties that you may have experienced with your order.

I am totally disgusted with IKEA . I am totally disgusted with IKEA. I wish I had read the reviews prior to placing my order. I placed it in the beginning of November to insure the items were delivered to me well before the Christmas rush. I was given a date of 4th Dec. for delivery which was perfect. The order arrived but with 13 items missing. I called immediately and a very helpful lady assisted me and after listing out the missing items I was told these would be dispatched from the Dublin shop on the Monday as she checked to insure they were in stock there. I waited a week but when nothing arrived I called again. Seems the order had never processed so I had to go through same thing all over again with another helpful lady and was told it would now arrive today 17 Dec. I took the day off work and waited but no delivery so I called to check and was told by another nice lady that unfortunately the order had NOT been processed. I saw red at that point. The options were that they could process it AGAIN but could not guarantee a delivery by Christmas. Some items were toys as gifts so this was not acceptable. At that point I had enough of IKEA and all this messing about so I asked for a refund for all the missing items only to be told this would take 10 to 14 days. I work in mail order and refunds only take 24 to 48 hours to show up in a customers account. They were very quick to charge my card for the full amount when the order was placed. At no point did I receive a notice that any of my order was out of stock and to see if I wanted a refund or to wait till they were available. There was no correspondence from the company once they had your money - it is the customer who has to keep trying to track down their order and sort out Ikea’s mistakes. This is not an acceptable way of doing business and I will never use them again and will warn others to be wary when placing an order.,Trustpilot_USA
"A host of issues, miscommunications and incompetency . I ordered a DJUNGELSKOG Soft toy, brown bear as a Christmas gift early in November from the Ikea online store. I scheduled delivery for the first week in December, which was the earliest available.

The order stated that I should receive notification of shipment a day or two before the scheduled delivery. When this didn't occur I called Ikea's customer support.

The customer representative explained that the order didn't process correctly as it had been stuck in the system. She explained that she would re-order the item for delivery later in the week and assured me the gift would be with me in time for Christmas as the local store had almost 30 in stock.

Two days later I was told the item had been cancelled and refunded as there was no stock available.

It has now been 14 days since the product was cancelled and refunded and there's no sign of any refund in my account. I contacted the customer support line again, and they confirmed that the refund had not been processed and that they'll try to push it along.

Next stop for me is a call to my bank for a chargeback.",Trustpilot_USA

"Terrible customer experience. . I placed an order of 3 items in October and was given a delivery date of 11/11 which is a long enough wait as it is, the day comes and no delivery nor an email or call to explain why. I contacted the customer service and was told my order will not be arriving until 4/12 which meant I placed my order in October and would have waited 2 months for it to arrive.
The 4th comes and again no delivery I gave them the benefit of the doubt by allowing an extra day before I contact the customer service and again no delivery the 6th comes and I received two parts of my order (A shelf for the wardrobe I ordered) but no wardrobe which was the main part of my order.
I contacted the customer service and was told the product I ordered was out of stock and this was the first I heard of this within the two months of which the order was placed, it also did not say out of stock on the website. The customer service employee had promised me I would get my order that coming Tuesday and to no surprise I did not get my product.
I again called the customer service and was met with a rude and very helpless customer service team member who seemed they couldn’t care less about my situation and gave me no information about my order and wouldn’t refund me the product as I had “gotten some of the order”. This is not the first time I’ve shopped with IKEA but I can assure it will be the last as this has been the worst customer experience I’ve ever had with a company.

The shop assistant told me someone from Ikea would call to give me an update. 2 days later I have received no call, and decided to call myself.

"Worse than MFI in the 1980s . We purchased a large EKET combination, costing just under £800. The plastic locking pins on one of the double cupboards side panels were all broken off when we opened the box. Another had a broken back panel. The door fittings are appalling and it is virtually impossible to get the doors fitted evenly around all 4 sides. It’s only due to the fact that I am an able DIY enthusiast that I could repair the damage and managed after 3 days work to complete the project.

Woke up this morning to 3 emails telling me that my ""order has successfully been cancelled"" and a refund will be issued shortly. Called customer service and had to wait over an hour to speak with a rep. She was honest and told me that they oversold many products and have been cancelling many orders. On top of that she said that there is no way to know when anything will come back in stock. When I initially made the order I had to change it many times due to things that were listed as unavailable once I went to checkout, but didn't show as such on the product page. I was working off the information that if I was able to order it, it would actually be available. Disappointing to know this is not the case, and severely weakens my trust in ordering off the website, knowing there's a good chance it will get cancelled. I have been waiting for many of the items to complete a renovation, but will now be shopping elsewhere as I am on a deadline.

"Very poor customer service . We had a large return order of unopened items with all of our receipts. We also went on a 'slow day' where there was hardly a line. We followed all the rules and the purchases were made less than a month from the return date. First of all, upon seeing the number of returns we had, every rep that glanced up suddenly had to pee to take a break. We finally ended up with a return customer service rep named Amanda who patiently helped us by going above and beyond to navigate a system that needs obscure information like a what register were you on and what day you bought this stuff. The Ikea computer system is really senseless and very hard to use I'm still not sure why she had to ""find"" all the receipts when we had them anyways but that is beyond the point. The thing that really struck me was how poor her coworkers treated Amanda and the situation. Not a one coworker came to help and IN FACT a neighboring coworker kept telling her to stop helping us out because now the line was backing up. She did this several times. Did I not matter as a customer? If things were taking too long for her, why did she not come over to help? OR why didn't any of the people literally standing around behind the swinging doors come help? Was the $15,000 I did spend at IKEA not important for the rep to help us through some returns that were responsibly handled and organized by us. Amanda thankfully ignored the selfish coworker and persevered. Amanda is a rare diamond of customer service skills in a generally large pool of apathetic, 'just here for the pay check and my manager is not watching' pool of employees found at IKEA. I have had several poor customer service experiences at IKEA that have made me really resent going there.",Trustpilot_USA

"IKEA Ireland - better shop online than going there . I find IKEA has become a more pleasant online shopping experience than visiting the shop. It is worth to pay the 50-60 Euro shipping costs (for heavy stuff) than going there yourself. Customer support on the phone is decent and responsive (waited maybe 5 minutes maximum in the last 5 interactions I had to make). IKEA stands behind their warranty and replaced our Friheten sofa for free after 5 years with a brand new one. So although the product doesn't last as long as you'd expect, the warranty does.

Due to COVID-19, It is unbelievably crazy how long are the lines. Don't go there, don't waste your life, better to order online and pay delivery. If you do decide to go, make sure to wait for COVID-19 to end. Then if you don't have a car use GoCar or Yuko.

The call charges to us for pursuing a problem entirely of IKEA's making has been £97.38, including five calls, each of less than 30 seconds and costing £6.45 EACH.

"How not to have a returns service . We recently purchased a wall mounted extractor hood for our cooker from IKEA.
Unfortunately there was no indication in the product details that the ""chimney"" part was not compatible with ceilings that have a coving.
We therefore need to return the the extractor hood. However, while the website says the IKEA returns policy is upto 365 days except for certain items, it is necessary to find a person in order to arrange this.
IKEA provides two numbers for customer service and after sales. Neither number usually works and simply provides a message that this number is not available and when it is the wait is interminable with possibly the worst on-hold music I have ever heard.
Most of the time you are directed to the IKEA Chatbot LATTJO. This does not help much and tends to take the harassed customer around in circles and usually back to the returns policy page.
It might be preferable to return the goods to the nearest collect and service centre, but that is shut.
IKEA may have some very nice products, but make sure you make a perfect choice and ensure you have checked all the dimensions provided. Make any sort of mistake and you are likely to have serious difficulty in sending to goods back for refund.
As often happens this review is written while listening to execrable on-hold music on the phone which is really an insult to the intelligence. It was 62 minutes into the call when a service person picked up the phone. He was very helpful but suffering from computer malfunctions which meant that he could not complete the return but would have to send me an email with the return details.
Very poor service even if the better stuff is value for money. probably not worth buying unless you live close to a store.
The pandemic is given as excuse but this is no excuse really especially for on-line customers. With at least another 6 months of risk for shoppers regardless of vaccines being available, one would of thought IKEA might have taken on more people to answer the phone. If Amazon can manage it so could IKEA. I cannot help wondering how many customers will have given up waiting.

In the past I made 6 unsuccessful trips to the Perth store to place an order (their website doesn’t recognise my address… turns out to be a fairly regular issue.) after calling and checking ALL items were in stock before driving the 50KM to the store.
Customer service phone lines are clearly understaffed or overwhelmed as I have never got through to someone without 30-40 min wait (at best, one time spent 4 hours in the queue.)

A refund took them 6 weeks to provide and almost 20 calls.

We tried to place one last order with them (I am a mug for doing this) and took a day off work for the delivery….. no delivery and no answer on the phone (they also provide the wrong number in their automated SMS.)

For a larger multinational business they provide a very poor level of service and I would think twice before using them for anything more than meatballs now.

4. Thursday, I go to the pick up point... and guess what product they don't have in the van? That's right, my carpet.
5. Another driver calls me later from a different part of town asking me why I am not there. I inform him they delivered to the wrong place, and he says customer service will call me tomorrow.
6. It should be no surprise at this stage that they never called, and I didn't get the carpet by the weekend. Instead, I am calling them now, only to find more than 1 hour waiting time. This review is being written to the sound of elevator music playing on my phone.",Trustpilot_USA

"Appalling service for defective draw . My kitchen draw was included in Ikea's 5 year guarantee. It was installed by Ikea commissioned tradespeople and one of the draws developed a fault in January 2020. They have asked me on 3 separate occasions to send photos of the defect which I've done. Eventually they agreed to supply a new draw and told me it was ready for dispatch, I then got an email threatening that if I didn't pay for it they will cancel the order.

"Can't buy online and none existent customer support or care...!!! . I selected 10 items for my Shopping Cart and was informed on the website that i can opt for Click and Collect at the checkout. Oh no you can't!!!! There is no option for Click and Collect so i tried the Delivery option. It then told me something was wrong and it couldn't process my order as an item is not available.

I went through the whole list and took out two items that it says are not available in the Dublin store and went back to check out. Still no Click and Collect option and it still can't be delivered. All the items are available but i can't get them delivered or collected.

I tried using the online bot.That only applies to the UK!!!! I tried calling but the number is unavailable and hangs up without even ringing. So that's it, i have a shopping order for €200 and i can't purchase it and Ikea couldn't care less about me as they can't provide a single way to contact them.

I tried web chat and it was not operational at this time,
I sent an email but still waiting on a reply,
I contacted them through Facebook yet no reply after I told them my items not came,

I called on Sunday morning and waited more than 1 1/2hrs to speak to someone and was told all 3 items are on back order I will get them if and when they arrive (but don’t know when that will be) or I can have a refund and that will take 10-14 days!!

I told them that’s not good enough & asked for an explanation as to why I wasn’t told it was on back order or that it wasn’t coming even after receiving several emails and txts to remind me the delivery was coming on the specified delivery date I paid for?

At this point the lady hung up the phone 😡😡😡
Ps- I wasn’t shouting, I wasn’t aggressive or abusive
I was actually being really nice to the lady and just asking for answers or a solution as to how they gonna fix things after making me stay home all day knowing it wasn’t coming??

"A wall of silence . My kitchen was installed a little over 2 years ago by Ikea. A leak has sprung from the dishwasher pipe, dripping on to the socket, This has been causing a short circuit, taking out all kitchen appliances, as well as CH. I contacted Ikea and was asked to send a photo, which I did. In the most obvious brush off, they replied that leak ""appeared to be"" coming from the house drain, and that I should arrange for repairs myself, as a matter of urgency, Now I am not a professional photographer, and cannot capture a drip in motion. I can, however, see it and touch it. It is coming from the pipe to the dishwasher installed by Ikea. This I have told them, twice, one week ago, only to be met by silence, So much for urgency!
I paid hugely more to have Ikea install the kitchen, rather than a third party. This was for the peace of mind offered by a 10 year warranty covering appliances and installation. Was this an expensive, empty promise?
It is worth noting that I am in Scotland, where Ikea stores remain open and customer services, at least in theory, are still working.",Trustpilot_USA

"Website shopping experience is the WORST I've ever seen. . The eCommerce experience is shockingly BAD, it's beyond embarrassing, a user experience disaster.

I would give ZERO stars if that was possible.

Which in this day and age, is completely unacceptable for a global multi-billion dollar PRIVATE company.

They (clearly) don't care about customer or user experience, about limiting your frustration or wasting your time. You can't add multiple of one item to your cart, you have to do that in the cart, after. You can't order any item for click and collect at your local store, if there are no spaces available that day - GOD forbid you want to look at availability of upcoming days–like you are able to with any other business that moved quickly to add curb-side pick up options during a time of COVID...even companies that are a fraction of the size and resources of IKEA can get it right - guess what? YOU CAN'T! You have to go back to the site EVERY DAY, like a lottery and wish and hope you are able to find available spot - only THEN can you complete your order - but it's all secret, like they don't want to tell you that they can only work one day at a time, with no view into a calendar of upcoming days.

Then if you are lucky enough to be able to complete your order, if any of the items in your cart are not available for click and collect OR delivery, they DELETE them from your cart - nope, they don't save it for future, give you the option to move it to a shopping list, so you can add them back in - they are just gone.

Availability - Yes it's in stock: but no, you can't purchase it. Inventory shows in stock (over 35 items), but when you try and check out, it says they are not available, when clearly, even after checking their phone line, with the item number, they are in fact very much in stock.

If their click and collect spaces are limited, why not have a message on the site, for customers to manage their expectations? Why not show more than 1 or 2 days availability for spaces available? Why not provide a message to your customers that are clearly having a terrible experience with your site? Why are you not looking to do things that will bring your customers back to you when this is all over.

"Where to begin? . Where to begin?! I used to spend thousands of dollars on IKEA products to furnish my entire home. Items were solid, quality, fairly inexpensive, and the end product looked good. Customer service USED to be reliable.

Fast forward to 3 years of not shopping at IKEA and so much has changed - for the WORST. Like most people during the pandemic, I needed a desk and chair to work from home. Nothing expensive, just something to get me through the next few months. I bought a LINNMON desk (under 30 dollars), and a LOBERGET/BLYSKÄR swivel chair (under 30). I actually visited the store to see the products and they were just not great but okay for the price, but good enough for the purpose of short-term telecommuting. Or so I thought.

I couldn't purchase the products in store, as they're basically out of everything during the pandemic, so I kept an eye on their stock, ordered the products online for in-person pick up (the website is a laggy and unintuitive MESS).

One item in my order was confirmed, the second (table) never was, even on the scheduled pick up day.

I drove an hour, again, to the store, had to chase staff down to find out why one order was still ""processing,"" got that sorted, then had drive to the garage to do a ""click and collect"" (which went easily enough). Got my items home, seemed simple enough to put together, at first sight.

However, when I went to put the table together, which comes in several parts (including the metal base the legs screw into), I had to struggle to try to get the screws in, because the cheap table top holes are so shallow and barely there, compared to the size of the screws (and no tools were provided), that I developed 3 blisters on the palm of my hand and *still* wasn't able to get the screws into the table! It's the cheapest, worst product in the history of my lifetime, and I've bought a lot of furniture in my adult life!

No luck trying to contact customer service. They haven't been answering their phones since July 2020! So, guess what? I'm returning both pieces, another hour's drive and an hour wait time to queue for the ""Return"" department, and I'm never shopping at IKEA again.

I used to love IKEA but, like everyone else who sold out to C h i n a - where the flimsy and cheap table and chair are made, quality is definitely not what one would call this junk. Plus, their site doesn't even allow reviews - at least, not that I've found a way to do so, and I've looked! - so *buyer beware* and make sure to read the lowest ratings on their site, as those are the actual real reviews!

having such poor experience at couch department section and customer service, no one was able to help me gather those parts and deliver to the client-myself. but they were keep given me excuses that parts are missing and awaiting for shipment. Therefore you cannot buy the couch, and some of them wanted me to buy the half parts and wait for the second missing parts, come back and purchase the rest of the missing parts and pay another delivery. Until, one guy, yes one guy from customer service name Alex, put an afford to schedule the parts available at Rhodes to be delivered, and open a case for the rest of missing parts and are available at Tempe. To be delivered and with no charge of delivery.
I am shocked for experiencing such poor customer service from 4 people and only the 5th one was the kind man and genuine whom helped with everything.

Alex, is an excellent asset to IKEA. he was very passionate despite my frustration from previous members from couch dep section and customer service. Alex treated me very nice and kind.
He was agreed with me on all of the levels of the frustration.
Such a genuine personality and kind.
I hope IKEA keeps and increase individuals as Alex and decrease unprofessional individuals.

"The worst experience . This Ikea order and delivery has been one of the worst experiences of my life.

Firstly, the order came damaged and we had to send it back and re-ordered it all again (63 packages - €4000). Secondly, some of the items that we first ordered, were not in stock anymore, and we had to chase them when they were back in stock, go and buy it ourselves as Ikea couldn't deliver them later (as it would have been normal because it was their mistake in the first place. We ordered the items when there were in stock). Then we had to chase for the refunds for weeks and call and stay on hold on the phone for hours.

Thirdly, we designed a wordrobe in the Ikea Dublin store, and the guys there forgot to put all the items from the store design in the actual order and bill. We realised when we wanted to build the wordrobe that some shelfs were missing, and that we never paid for them as they were not put in the bill (just the design). Lastly, when the final order came, there were 63 packages - 459kg in total. I had to carry them all myself and another friend (some packages had 50kg and I have 50kg). I understand the covid rules, but it's insane that they didn't even bring them in front of the apart. door. What was I supposed to do? Make 5 orders and pay the delivery fee every time just so we could cary the 50kg items 4 floors?

On top of all of these, the delivery guys delivered us 2 - 50kg packages that were not ours. We had to carry them all the way up, and then chase for the collect team to come one week after.

The most horrible experience overall, and Ikea was not helpful at all even if we had a very large order. The contact support centre was ok, the people were nice, but for nothing if the delivery guys and people in the deposit messed up and damaged our delivery and then the wordrobe designer didn't export all the items in the actual order and bill....",Trustpilot_USA

"Broken online ordering, no delivery, non-existent customer service . I've had the same experience as the gentleman with the previous review. Place order and was fully charged. I received 3 of 15 items. The online system made it appear that the rest being prepared or on its way. After a month, nothing else has been delivered with NO change to the online order status (still appears as either in transit or being prepared).

The support line won't connect calls to an agent. The online site only allows emails for cancellations. I tried the cancellation route to simply get a message to them. After 2 more weeks I got a reply from 3rd party support company. They asked for the very same information that was already in the reply email (order number and my request). I replied politely giving again the order number and request. No reply.

This is not a covid issue. IKEA seems to have a broken system for successfully processing orders and definitely is broken as it relates to providing customer service.

I asked about compensation as this was not an accident but a broken item was loaded wasting my time the delivery driver and now our time he said nothing but he would send me a £20 voucher in the next 7 days.

I asked to speak to someone else he refused to put me through to anyone as this was also the polcy.

Oh and the £20 voucher hasn’t arrived.

Need something to sit on so talked to customer service who said I could have it and they will send another when it comes back on stock.

"Shockingly poor customer service at Ikea at the moment . My friend Anna and I made an online Ikea order in September and was initially given a delivery date before the end of that month. At the last minute the date was put back to 1st October which was acceptable. We had of course paid for our items in full as normal (just under £110) and we had received a confirmation email of the payment and order, followed by a message confirming our order was complete and all was running to plan. Then nothing?! When we attempted to track our order the file simply says 'our order is being prepared' even though we had already been told everything had been compiled?! We can't seem to cancel the order or request a refund, we can't seem to reach anyone on the phone despite several attempts and the online chat link through the 'customer service' section of the website we found was extremely basic and very unhelpful. We are feeling very angry that on October 15th we are still waiting for our delivery and can get no further information about the delays or any idea about when we can expect to receive our purchases. We have been extremely patient and this experience has now deeply scarred our trust in Ikea. As online shopping is likely to be the main way in which purchases are made during the pandemic this will directly affect any decision we make about future shopping with Ikea. We are seeking a swift resolution to this shoddy and inconsiderate service if Ikea cares about customer experience at all.

NO ONE CAME ON THE DELIVERY DATE.
We called Ikea customer service (1hour). They didn't know why the kitchen wasn't delivered but informed us that in any case, most items are out of stock in Montreal. We reminded them that the kitchen installer was coming in 7 days and we were facing $$ penalties if he wasn't able to do his job. They committed to find some stocks at boucherville. They told us that our issue would be raised as a top priority and someone from Boucherville will call us back the following day to schedule a delivery before end of week.
NO ONE CALL US BACK THE FOLLOWING DAY
We called Ikea customer service back. One hour wait. They said they were not able to reschedule a delivery as the systems was saying the delivery already occured! They said that our file was ""being processed"" and there is nothing they can do to ensure a delivery before the installation date and most items are out of stock in Montreal.

"The delivery guy straight up lied about… . The delivery guy straight up lied about ""trying"" to contact us besides phoning us according to the explanation of the customer service. I admit, it is my fault that I had bad phone signal while they tried to call me. But the guy also called me before the ""vereinbarte Lieferzeitraum"".

Then I called the IKEA delivery guy, and he said things like: nicht mein Job, ich bin Beschaeftigt, rufen Sie die Kundenservice an. Lieferung jetzt? Nein! In ein Monat. Ich habe keine Zeit zum Liefern. Wir waren da. Auf wiedersehen! Lieferung nicht möglich. Wir sind beschäftigt. Ich gebe Ihnen meine Kollege (then he put the phone aside, not even listening).

His German was just as broken as indicated by the 7-13 delivery feedback, then he hang up on me. I gave him a second chance to explain himself why he didn't ring the Intercom and why he didn't just go to the Reception of the building. There was a person sitting right at the entrance, whose job includes welcoming delivery staff, so at least he could have tried. DHL found us. Even DPD found us. Anyone on a 7-10EUR budget found us. IKEA on a 100EUR spedition budget couldn't find us.

The Intercom instructions were in the address. We were all the time at home and no-one rang. I asked the receptioninst if anyone came during the indicated time, and no-one had been there.

Yet, once I called the customer service, he saw a record that they had tried to reach me, they tried to ring, they even came in the building and didn't find my ""Briefkasten"" (hint: it's there, and before finding my Briefkasten, the Receptionist would have surely asked them if she could help).
Therefore, I asked myself, why didn't the receptionist see anything and despite obvious Intercom numbers, why didn't we hear anything in the apartment? Either the spedition lied, or we are both deaf (hint: I can hear quite well) and the receptionist is blind (hint: she saw me quite well once I spoke to her). I also tested both the intercom and the doorbell. They worked. So then, the only conclusion I can find is that some lazy people want to avoid work by blaming failed delivery on some excuse. However, based on the above proof, the blame failed.

In exchange for paying 100EUR delivery costs, I expect a higher quality of service. Obviously, I asked for a full refund including the spedition costs. To make sure it happens on time, I informed my credit card company requesting a chargeback having explained the situation.

Furthermore, while speaking to customer service, I reported the delivery staff for the horrible service.

In the unlikely case the 100% refund is disputed, I will continue voicing my opinion elsewhere, there are great forums.",Trustpilot_USA

We will be organizing a petition for more pay, because we do Specialist Work & only get Assistant pay. This is illegal and we will not tolerate being treated like damn Slaves!

First of all a Audit needs to happen for all these Trashy, lazy ass managers! They keep picking with us with quality, so that we cannot grow. The calls come in every 4 seconds, we have no voice or support and quality should ALWAYS be out-sourced, with people that have never worked onsite. Not a big ugly gorilla, that worked right in the building with all of us. So they work hand and hand with managers that want to pick with us, by giving bad scores. Please do an Audit as soon as possible and you can see what we mean.

I know managers that are no longer with the company and have shared that they get people to call in to do prank calls, just to mess with certain people, so that they get bad scores. We think you should send a decoy to see what's going on. Also, we want Quality to be people who have Never seen us and don't know Any of the Management.

Please understand, we are tired of having are jobs tested and toyed with. If you send someone in to look at the stats, you will see the people they keep messing with. It is so sad to work for a company that allows Management and quality to play with the co-workers livelihood.

We also have not received ANY hazard pay for using our electricity and internet at home. We are going to speak to a News Station, Government Official and a Union Rep, because we are tired of being treated like crap!

"WORST customer service, FALSE information given to customer in person . We placed two in-store kitchen appliances (gas stove and refrigerator) for my elderly parents. Please note we would NOT have purchased it from Ikea if there's no delivery to the room of our choice due to these being heavy kitchen appliances, we would have gone elsewhere. 
In-store home delivery department associate Julia D as listed specifically told me ""these will be delivered to whichever room you would like."" I have also found the below screenshot from the Ikea website and highlighted in yellow on which items can be delivered to your room of choice due to COVID time.Delivery guys were extremely rude from the way they spoke and their actions. And neither one wore any face mask on or any PPE when approaching. My parents even provided PPE from face masks to shoe covers for them, they kept saying it's COVID (but not wearing PPE, that's very ironic).
The delivery guys also dropped the refrigerator on purpose out of spite after my parents told them they will be calling to complain. Not being able to get these inside, we have no way of testing if these are in good condition and workable.The incident today really caused a massive amount of frustrations for my parents due to what they had to deal with today and now leaving two items currently sitting in the garage. Also, we felt that we have been lied to by the associate given out false information. This has by far the WORST customer service we have experienced, what if my parents didn't have a garage and it's currently raining season in Florida, are these heavy items supposed to be sitting out. These items are still sitting at the garage because no one can lift or move them, it's not really a garage decor.
We need a solution on this issue ASAP as this is absolutely ridiculous: from being misinformed in store, getting unnecessary rudeness from the delivery people to unreachable customer service.

I was interested only because I'm now stuck with an Ektorp sofa, chair, and footstool with no options for slipcovers. Ikea discontinued the series with no notice so for all of us that bought Ektorp this year, we seem to be out of luck.

Already at delivery there were several issues; the new dishwasher was damaged on one side, wrong fridge door, the kitchen worktop was missing, wrong hinges for several doors, the side panel has been delivered at a wrong address.

The person where this panel was delivered contacted me, however the panel is too big to transport without a van. Still, this person was so kind to bring this panel to my house with his trailer (thank you!).

On top of that, today I tried to contact customer service, waited 1hr09mins on the phone in vain, a second time again 45mins and last time 59mins in vain!!
And of course all these phone costs are on you!

Finally managed to speak to someone, they promised to call me back, till today not a single Ikea-ring on my phone.

They were going to deliver the missing worktop this Saturday, I waited at home and saw…nobody! Again on hold at customer service without ever speaking to someone, just one automated mail, “Unfortunately, something went wrong. We are sorry…..”

The guarantee on the kitchen appliances start from order date, this was 6 months ago and I cannot even install my kitchen! It is a disgrace.

You would think that if they make mistakes, they would do everything possible to solve them and limit the damage instead of creating extra frustrations.

And get this…they blame all of it on the Corona-crisis. Lame and easy excuse.

The first order I placed took over a month to deliver. Checking out was near impossible since I needed to ship to an order different than my billing address, their system would not allow it. I had to first buy a gift card, which took over a week to be emailed to me, and then use it instead of my credit card. Later, I tried placing a second order. (Big mistake!) When it needed to be cancelled, it took 2 phone calls, both of which I was on hold for over 45 minutes before anyone answered. Then, it took one month and 2 more hour long phone calls to get the refund for the canceled order. After the first phone call, I immediately received an email confirming the cancellation. But, weeks later I realized the customer service agent never processed the refund. When I tried to reorder, IKEA would not let me check out until I removed several items they decided were “limited quantity”.

"Terrible experience with Ikea. . Terrible experience with Ikea.

I ordered a desk, bin, shelves and a jar on June 30th for a 19th August delivery date (it was the earliest they offered) - a slot that I paid for. It never showed up and the tracking didn't change from the day of dispatch.

I tried to contact customer service via phone 3 times only to be thrown off the queue after 35+ minutes of waiting. I sent numerous emails, Twitter messages, tweets and Facebook messages with no response.

When I finally got though on the phone, I was told that the desk was out of stock but the other items could still be delivered to me. I said no, I want the whole order cancelled and refunded.

1. Why wasn't I contacted? I had booked a time slot on the 19th August and had no contact whatsoever from Ikea to say that the item wasn't available.
2. Why weren't my other items delivered to me on the 19th August?

Customer service worker was nice about it, she apologised. She had no explanation for why I wasn't contacted as there wasn't one - it's just neglectful. If a small business took a customers money and didn't deliver the products with no contact whatsoever they would be ruined, this isn't acceptable.

5 months later, they've collected the item but issued me a GIFT CARD instead of my cash. I never asked them for a gift card, nor did they offer. It's taking me 2 weeks to get my actual money back, in fact, I'm on hold with hem now..

So got all the parts, went home, and looked at the shipping list and sizes of the frames.....they were NOT correct. I remember as 160cm will only fit in my room where I want it, this was exceeding 200.
I rang and rang for hours......worst service ever. They made me drive up 5 hours again, to return everything and refund me..I asked for a gift card worth 74 euro for the shipping to be covered as I'll have to order it online. Which they gave me.

Eventually the wardrobe came back into stock, but hey guess what?, The gift card won't work.

I spent 3 weeks in emails, incl about 5 hours in waiting time for calls to be connected...

I'm STILL waiting for them to fix the gift card problem to this day, and also expecting a delivery on the 28th of September, but reading other comments here....I'm doubtful.

"1.5 months out atm and nothing has been delivered . I first tried to place an order about 5 months ago and the computer program wasn't working properly, with availability varying from moment to moment, and so I called customer service directly. After 30+ minute I finally got through and spent the next hour with the rep who kept thinking they could get the items I requested, but every single attempt failed, and so in the end they recommended I try again in 2 weeks, which I kept on doing over the course of ~2 months.

Finally, the items showed as available for delivery, and so I place the $1,700 order and scheduled the earliest delivery date that was 12 days out. I was informed that the delivery company would contact me and provide updates on the status of the delivery, which they did using an app that showed how the process was proceeding.

I took off from work on the day of stated delivery, was given a 9am-9pm delivery window, and in the morning the app showed everything was set, but just not out for delivery, so I waited until 7pm and called the freight company and was informed that I needed to wait until 9pm. Well the delivery wasn’t made, so again I checked the app the next morning and it showed it was out for delivery, so I took another day off, but since I am here writing this highly negative review, you can surmise it never showed up.

This was particularly upsetting as most of the items were for my 84 year old dad, who ended up sleeping on an air mattress for an evening as we dissembled his bed after we saw the order was out for delivery, and naturally he was quite disappointed it never showed up.

What followed were hours of unproductive phone calls over days, where the freight company blamed IKEA for not releasing their “hard hold” on the merchandise, who then said I needed to contact IKEA and resolve this, and in return with IKEA claiming the freight company had lost the items in their own warehouse.

It is important to realize that both parties expected me to be the intermediary on their behalf in repeated phone call over days, and that each time I had to again contact IKEA the process took hour for each call that did finally connect, with the majority of calls leading one through a voice menu maze, which would then flat out tell you they could not answer your call at this time. Also, they really need to change their on-hold messages, as repeatedly telling the customer how simple and efficient the online ordering process is, and prodding them to go online instead (which gives one no resolution options), is infuriating.

After all was said and done I easily spent over 8 hours total between IKEA and their designated freight company, with each blaming the other, only to finally have IKEA admit that it was their fault, and they simply didn’t have the items after all. I said to one of their reps, “I am going to ask to a straightforward question, is there any system in place to inform the customer that their order isn’t actually going to be delivered?”, to which he flatly replied “No”, and I laughed saying, “Well at least that’s an honest answer”. A subsequent interaction was, far worse with a different rep attempting to assign blame on me stating that I should have known that their system sends out an email confirming the order has been successfully processed, to which I pointed out I was also told that the freight company would inform me of delivery status, which they did, resulting in 2 days of lost work. She then continued the cycle of blaming the freight company, without accepting any responsibility of IKEA who of course should be overseeing the entire process involved in making sure their products are actually in stock, and are being actually delivered when their designated freight provider informs the customer of the pending delivery. Also note that the one go to option the reps kept pushing was to just cancel the order, obviously to take this issue off of their plate.

So 1.5 months out from the original scheduled delivery date, I have received nothing, not a single item from the order, I have received no notification of status or redelivery scheduling, and I am quite convinced that no one even knows my order exists in the computer system as I have been specifically informed that there is no system in place to inform customers on delivery delays.

IKEA is undoubtedly the worst online shopping experience I have ever encountered, with representatives that are functionally incapable of resolution options other than simply canceling the order, who don’t take primary responsibility for their incompetence, and are at times aggressively argumentative.",Trustpilot_USA

Did this and phoned to add on to order. After 2 very long calls (on hold for 45 minutes each) I thought it was all sorted. Last Thursday the 4 additional pieces arrived at the house. The rest was to be collected from Aberdeen on Sunday. Call received late Sunday morning to say nothing had arrived as there was some mix up. After another very long wait on the phone I had a very unhelpful call with customer services, only to be told by the very bored sounding Ikea employee that it was a stock issue and some of the pieces were now out of stock!!! How could this be.....they were in stock at the time of payment so surely they should have been aside with my name on it?? It wasn't my fault that they couldn't deliver to Aberdeen sooner and I certainly wouldn't have expected that they would just go ahead and resell the units. The bored guy on the phone said....could be November.....or maybe next year!! But basically he really couldn't care less. So I am now £1200 out of pocket and have no idea what's happening because no one has been in touch with me since the Case was raised (whatever that means!!)

"Poor, poor customer service. I’m so very disappointed with my recent… . I’m so very disappointed with my recent interaction with IKEA. While redoing my studio I put in a order online in the middle of August, to be delivered to my local pick up point September 9. I received a confirmation that my order was processed & so I waited to be notified when it was ready for me to pick it up.
September 9 came & went, nothing, then September 10, I received an email containing a refund statement for the whole order. No explanation, apology or anything. So I phoned the one customer service number & waited an hour & 15 minutes before talking to a representative. He was pleasant enough but sounded very resigned to the whole situation without being able to give me any explanation for them completely dropping the ball. He quoted my return would be processed in 5-7 days on my visa, but gave me a case number to follow up with if that didn’t happen!
So disappointed in this whole process, I waited weeks for a order that didn’t even leave the warehouse without any notice from IKEA at all. Poor, poor customer service.

Sales on the other end tells me there was an unexpected delay and it needs to be rescheduled for four days later. I asked why there wasn't even a courtesy call to let me know at the start of the day and I had people hired to move and assemble this furniture (it was furniture for the whole house), and even a normal person cannot be expected to figure this out automatically. The agent took a very cavalier ""take it or leave it attitude"" - with no guarantee to meet the next date, unable to change it to click and collect, and the possible refund taking an approximately 15 business days (I had already explained to him this was ~3k of furniture and if I have to re order, I can't wait three weeks in an empty house).

I asked them if I could secure the item for pickup on Wednesday they said they could not and had no resolution they could assist with. But I would receive a refund after 14 days. I called today after more then 14 days. I was on the phone for an hour again. I was told it can take up to 3 weeks or longer.

"Sent wrong color doors and have made it impossible to contact them. . We have purchased (and assembled ourselves) 3 IKEA kitchens. I do really like their kitchen cabinets.

However, their customer service is non existent. Our IKEA built-in microwave oven broke down so we ordered a different oven. We had to modify the IKEA cabinet that the oven is in, and needed different size doors. As the kitchen system (SEKTION) is still being produced and the color name was identical to the kitchen we had purchased (GRIMSLÖV), we thought this would be easy. We were warned that the doors would take a long time (took about 6 weeks). However, when we got the doors they were the wrong color. I still had an extra deco piece still in the box, so I'm positive I got the color correct. GRIMSLÖV is a medium reddish brown brown, but the doors we were sent were a dark chestnut brown. The two colors are not even close. I attempted to contact IKEA, but ""due to heavy call volume"" they hung up on me. I couldn't even leave my number for a call back. I thought, okay I'll email them. On their website they are only taking emails for canceled orders! So they are making it impossible to contact them. I sent an order cancelation anyway, but I don't hold out any hope that they'll respond. I tried to find another email or phone number where I could talk to a person but no luck so far.

"Crazy Delivery Costs . We ordered a few products at the start of the UK’s lockdown and while the delivery was a bit expensive we did it. All went fine.

So we go back to make another order and the delivery prices are ridiculous. £30 to deliver a £35 flat pack bookcase! I sent a super heavy seat from a land rover via a courier for less than that!

Then tried to do a small item order and they want £15 for delivery! Forget it...

Go to the store and the queues are massive and being asthmatic I just don’t yet feel comfortable (rightly or wrongly) so frankly this feels like price gouging.

We’re now shopping elsewhere. Will Ikea care? Not until enough people have had enough, but with the significant shift to online sales I think they’ll feel it at some point.

"Dreadful service fro Ikea . I really dont dont know why I am bothering because IKEA obviously dont give a damn but here goes.
We ordered a wardrobe on August 28th and asked for delivery and assembly. We were told that the carcass would be sent from store but as the doors were coming from Distribution there would be a £30 charge for delivery !
I protested and the £30 was waived.
We were then told that a shelf was out of stock and we would have to watch for it being in stock and collect it , a 120 mile round trip !
The alternative was to pay £9 for delivery.
Having waited for hours we ordered it but back at home we decided to cancel it.

I booked a delivery for Sunday the 6th, now somehow it’s Tuesday the 22nd. They have my email, my phone number and my address, they could have emailed, phoned, text’d or even sent me a letter to discuss the change of delivery date, but they did none of that.

Was told it was because there had been water near them. ITS A KITCHEN!!!! water does get used in a kitchen. I said I wasn’t expecting the whole kitchen to be replaced, just those with damage.

"Still Haven't Received My Order . There are no words to express how utterly disappointed I am in IKEA and your handling of your online orders. It is absolutely understandable that you have had to make logistical changes to your operation during a time like this; however, a lack in handling of proper customer service is not only damaging to your consumer and reputation but also to your employees who are trying to cope with all of this. I placed my order on May 4th, and I have been patiently waiting to receive it. I even tried to cancel the order because word had arrived that the stores would be reopening, and for that time frame, I could just make the purchase at the store. I was excited to receive a notification back in June that my order was shipping only for the tracking of the package to be stagnate in Lakeland, FL. I have had no communication at all nor been able to reach anyone from IKEA since placing or attempting to cancel my order. Yesterday, August 12th, I received a notification that my order had been delivered. Nothing was at my door and upon checking my package tracking, the same indication that my package has not left Lakeland, FL is in fact still there. I find it ironic that this survey has been sent for me to share my experience concerning a customer service conversation that I have not had with anyone. I would in the very least like a refund if you are not going to send my package. As an alternative, I'm willing to pick the items up from my local IKEA store in Atlanta. What I will not do is continue to wait for IKEA to decide that I, a consumer who used to advocate for IKEA and its products, am to be disregarded as nothing more than a money grab. By all means, share this with the individual(s) who are in charge of this mess.",Trustpilot_USA

"Unprofessional . Bought a table of Ikea.com and it was supposed to arrive in a few days. After about a month of waiting, it still had not arrived. I wondered what the problem was and I looked up if they were having trouble mailing to my area. I found a social media post by them saying that they are having trouble and almost all the comments were from costumers saying Ikea had not delivered their items. I saw another social media post very similar on facebook. They claimed their issues delivering are due to the virus, but the first social media post was from 2 years ago. I finally got a refund after contacting the better business bureau about the problem. When I had contacted Ikea directly on the phone, a robot said the line was busy and then hung up. When I contacted them on social media, I never got a response. Ikea later sent me a $20 gift card as a way to make things better I guess, but It didn't even work. If they can not deliver items they should not be offering that as a part of their business. Very unprofessional. Also, if do accept payment with no intent on actually giving the buyer their item, they are no better than thieves.",Trustpilot_USA

Whilst I appreciate COVID has affected all businesses your communication strategy is diabolical. I will be taking this higher as this is genuinely the worst customer service I have ever received.

I asked for an exchange she said she was happy to do that and when I requested a refund for delivery as this mattress clearly was falsely advertised she turned round and said ""nah"". With that same employee she gave me a number to call to pay the difference for the exchange therefore I hung up after being on the phone for 75 minutes to realise she gave me the same number I was just calling on!

Disaster strikes.. I had to spend my afternoon attempting to wrap my poorly advertised mattress in bin liners and upon finishing I'd wasted hours of my time.

This is where it gets juicy, I FINALLY paid the difference which took me two days to do as first the payment system was down and the following day all phone lines were down. When I finally got through I paid and then received an email to say my payment was late which means the exchange has been delayed, delayed!!! through no fault of mine! their systems were down and now I'm paying the price.

ordered 15 items on the 05/08/20 and were scheduled to arrived on the 21/08/20 , i received an update on the 21st that my delivery would arrive between 10-11am that morning. did my delivery arrive? no of course not and after ringing customer service 7 times and then finally getting through to someone after 45 mins on hold i was told they don't know where my delivery was that it had been loaded into the truck that morning but the delivery driver had not delivered anything on his list yet this was at 15.40 and that if it didn't arrive to call again tomorrow or the next day. That was Fine.

Then I got a notification at 16:10 that my delivery had arrived at 10:30 which it hadn't then refreshed and got that it was delivered at 16:05 so i then got on to customer service web chat after another 45 mins wait the told me that they will have to search the warehouse for my order which would take 3-5 days and then reorder my items and send it out again and then ended the chat there.

so i rang customer service again for now the 10th time trying to get through to them, a nice man answered herd everything i had to say and he himself was confused why my delivery had been marked delivered he then got in contact with the delivery manager who then rang my partner and said that the delivery driver feck up and crossed off our order as delivered when he actually delivered the one below ours e.g ours was no.3 on his list he delivered no.4 but ticked off no.3 , so the manager then told us that they were very sorry and will deliver the order this morning (22/08/20) between 10-11am.

"Products are okay, but customer support is sooooo bad! . Edit : They did make it right. Received the product a year later, but I already managed to get another one in store.

I bought my kitchen cabinets at IKEA in march 2020. They delivered it in May, but one box was missing (an important one at that).

They told me that it was back-ordered in Canada and that they didn't even know when they would get one, but they told me not to worry and that I would get it in time for my remodel in August. In July, someone from customer support called me and told me that they could get one delivered on August 20th, so I planned my assembly / kitchen remodel for August 21th, because well, I wasn't going to waste another day without a freaking kitchen.

I was there from 9AM to 9PM, near the front door not even taking the time to freaking eat. I wasted an entire day for that item, and they didn't even come.

So I tried to call them, chat with them, nothing. You get on hold and get flushed after 2 hours. They won't even answer on Facebook messenger.

How is IKEA still alive and well with such a poor customer support?",Trustpilot_USA
"Bad delivery. Bad customer service. . I ordered 2 items on IKEA, and had to pay for the delivery service.
I had to wait more than one week for it to be delivered. Then, IKEA surprised me. Only one was shipped, but in the receipt in the packet, it said both 2 items were delivered. Where is the other?
I tried to called to IKEA, at least 5 times in one hour. But the line is always busy.
What should I do next? Is IKEA trying to steal my money? I don't know, but I know its service is the worst ever.

We wanted to ask if they have high cabinets the size we needed. We were wearing masks, but since I have a health condition I can't cover a nose. She looked at me and said ""Cover your nose"". I told her that due to a health condition, I can't. Then she turned her back and said, ""Then find another sales person"". I said ""OK"" and we went to a line to another sales person. Then she came back and said "" Since he is busy, you can order items online"". I told her that if you have them now, we want to buy since we made a 50min drive to the store. However, she was insisting to look online because, as she said, nobody in the store will serve me without covering nose. We had to drive back home without being helped.

IKEA product quality control
QA/QC is free falling down the gutter, with the simplest accessories failing within hours from purchase. In a large expensive wardrobe (far more expensive than than the market average) the last thing you'd worry about is the plastic holder of the metal rail. Yet, ridiculously, the metal rail holder snapped and collapsed with a only few clothes hangers, a moderate load, within a few hours from installation..
Many other details, metal hinges, plastic accessories, stopped matching, and break as if they are made of ice or dough.
A very expensive LED bathroom mirrored shelf doesn't have a switch - the most basic expectation when selling an electrified item.

IKEA global.
Beware fake ratings. Product ratings aren't available on all Ikea domains (understandable since the products are only getting worse) . But where they are, such as in Canada, they are fraudulent. Example: On a Komplement hanging rail for the hugely overpriced PAX modular wardrobes they listed 35 rating, 30 of them being negative (1 out of 5 stars), mostly because it breaks straight away. Ikeas fake product rating however, ended up showing as 4.4 out of 5. That's low, IKEA, very low...

IKEA Ireland, Dublin.
(Older review)
Product gets 4 stars out of 5 (due to Ikea systems).
In-store Customer service in Dublin gets 0 stars out of 5 (most Irish staff are sour-faced with unhelpful and hostile attitude, and they make you feel like you're inconveniencing them with your non-sense questions). Horrible experience doesn't begin to describe it. Narrow minded 1d10ts, who don't appreciate yuo are paying their salaries, even when you spend many thousands euro shopping in IKEA. Luckily there are a few foreign staff who are infinitely nicer and more helpful.
That's what typically happens when the government gives a new company the green light, but conditions them to mostly hire the ""deprived"" locals. In this case the good but entitled folk from Ballymun...

IKEA call centre
Call center gets 3 star out of 5 (nice and helpful staff, obviously based outside Ireland. But despite estimating that you'll wait 1-2 minutes, they keep you waiting for 28 minutes)

IKEA kitchen design team
Nice enough staff, but largely inexperienced, very quick to advice me to place large fixed filler panels in a space where they just didn't know how to insert other smaller modules (from their readily available ranges). Needless to say wasting priceless space in kitchens is almost criminal, particularly when storage space comes at a massive premium. Due to their poor design advise, I cut kitchen counters shorter than they needed to be. So I had to add it back later with unsightly visible joints..
I ended up redesigning portions of my modular kitchen, returning the useless but expensive glossy filler panels and replacing them with more valuable modular presses and drawers in IKEA..

IKEA delivery service

"IKEA stole my money . I am so frustrated. I placed my order back on May 6th 2020 and was expecting a delivery on May 25th. It never showed up. I tried calling for 6 weeks and I couldn’t reach anyone. I couldn’t even send them an email. Once I finally got through 6 weeks later, I was told that they were trying to locate my order but they themselves couldn’t get through and I had to call back (spent 50mins on phone). I called back a week later and they informed me that my order had been canceled on May 27th,
2020. I have no idea why they took it upon themselves to cancel my order and not send me any notice. The biggest problem is that they cancelled my order but NEVER refunded my money $185. I have since called twice was given a case number and been told I needed to wait 5-7 business days. It has now been 16 business days since my first phone call and they STILL have not refunded my money. I can’t even get through anymore. This is THEFT... they have stolen my money.

"Insanely bad experience . Insanely bad experience. Ikea was out of stock on several items in my cart and since they don't have any ability to order items and wait for them to come in stock, I waited almost 2 months to put the order in. I finally was able to order the full kitchen in early July. The delivery date from Ikea was set for July 24. Next thing I know, the delivery service (XPO Delivery) randomly showed up at my door with my order on July 22.
""Hello this is your Ikea delivery. We are at your house.""
No one was home. ""Why are you there? The delivery is scheduled for July 24.""
""We are here now. Do you want us to leave everything in your driveway?""
""No, it's going to rain.""
""Ok, you will need to reschedule the delivery."" That night I got ""Your delivery was a success!"" confirmation emails from both Ikea and XPO.

This entire time, due to Covid-19, Ikea was not taking any customer service calls or emails - only emails to cancel orders. I called XPO. They said only Ikea can reschedule the delivery and I need to wait. I wait for a week. Nothing. I call XPO back and the XPO rep says they have a new delivery date of August 7. I am annoyed but at least the delivery is set.

On August 5, I get a ""Delivery rescheduled"" confirmation email for Sunday *August 9*. I call and ask what happened to August 7? XPO says they don't know but the delivery is definitely Sunday, August 9. ""The delivery is scheduled for some time between 9am and 9pm.""
Today is August 9. I called XPO twice during the day to confirm the delivery was on its way. ""Yes, they are in transit.""

After sitting at home all day waiting for the delivery (on a Sunday), at 8:35pm I called XPO to get a status. ""Oh yes, your order is not coming today.""
""WHY NOT?!""
""I have no more information. I will transfer you to Ikea to reschedule the delivery.""
...""You're hold time for the next Ikea representative is...75 minutes.""
So I am writing this as I wait on hold with Ikea. I fully expect to be disconnected before someone answers, or they are going to say ""XPO has your order. You must talk to them to reschedule.""

Meanwhile, this has gone on so long, I have lost the contractor who was scheduled to install everything, as they had to move on to other jobs.

I want to cut some slack to businesses in these difficult times, but screwing up the date 4 times, with absolutely no recourse and terrible/no communication is ridiculous. And to make someone sit at home on a weekend and wait for a delivery that never comes - after confirming multiple times it's on its way - is beyond maddening.

If this ever gets resolved, it will be my last Ikea purchase for a loooong, loooong time.",Trustpilot_USA

Returned home and decided to order online. Called numerous times to check status of order and each customer service rep told me something that contradicted the prior person. Finally received an email it would be delivered on a set date. Well, on that date, the doorbell did ring and a driver from Ikea was at the door. The driver had a small package. It was the fabric for the ottoman and not the ottaman! Spent three hours trying to reach customer service. Finally reached a human who said it was on backorder.

230 - 20529996 -My experience with Ikea is so heartless and so horrible! First off I ordered my items last June 8, 2020. And the delivery should have been on July 12 but until now we’re on July 30 and still the delivery company of Ikea which is XPO logistics is screwing up in delivering my items. They re-scheduled me for 2nd time on a Sunday afternoon, I received a call from delivery driver a day before to confirm and I thought it’s going to be successfully delivered this time , but then on that day , I waited again for nothing, wasting 4 hours of my time . I could have gone somewhere for my other errands. I called up the driver who called me a day before because their customer service in XPO is closed on a Sunday and now his reason was that the delivery truck got broken and so my parcel had to be transferred to another truck with a different driver! Why they didn’t inform me?! I really don’t understand why! And so the next business day , tried to reach Ikea Customer Service , they rescheduled me again for the 3rd time, again I waited and spent 4 hours of my time at home waiting in vain for the 3rd time . This time they couldn’t give me an answer. I’m literally losing my patience already of their false hopes and false reassurances. I reached them out in Social media fb and instagram but seems like they don’t care and don’t really read my concerns. They keep on asking for my order # and keep on saying apologies but the problem is not being fixed at all. And now still giving them a chance for the fourth time to re-schedule me for today Thursday July 30, I called up XPO an hour prior to my delivery time frame to make sure , the agent said my parcel is already loaded in the truck, it’s on its way and that they’re shouldn’t be any problem. So I got an alert at 1pm that they’re coming in 30 minutes , 2pm passed , still nothing arrives. 3 pm passed and I’m still waiting, I called up again , and the agent said just wait since driver still has 5pm to arrive. So as usual, 5 pm passed but none came. I called up again , and now this is the shocking answer of the agent , “I’m sorry but you’re parcel won’t be delivered today unfortunately because the driver didn’t able to find your order..”
-What!!!? Are u kidding me?!Now they have two contrary statements from previous agent. I mean what kind of service is this?! It’s not easy to wait on queue to speak to someone who can help when no one actually wants to help. I have to wait for so long just to reach someone, I’m trying to ask for a Supervisor to call me back but no one did. They only want you to call their Customer Service hotline that’s gonna make you wait for years and they just put u on hold . I don’t understand why no one from any of them is calling me back when I already told them my availability which is 7pm onwards everyday. The worst part for today that’s making me mad right now is I took a day off from work! Just for this delivery that’s not happening, who is going to compensate me for the hours of work that I lost ??

Second of all, beginning of June I ordered a bunch of items and chose the click & collect option for July 21st. How ridiculous again that your staff can't put aside a few items any sooner than a month and a half. Third, I was sent no email following up what time I should pick up the order so I call them. An hour and a half later, they pick up and give me a bunch of useless information about my order (like how much it amounted to - why?!) only to tell me that NO ONE has prepared my order and It's therefore, not ready. I was asked to order again with no availability to pick up until September 11th!!!! I asked the lady ""Why doesn't Ikea just send my few things on a delivery truck? This is inconvenient since I have already waited a long time"" And that lying woman says ""Oh no trucks in that area"" It's downtown Toronto near Yonge Street and I see your trucks almost every day in the neighbourhood.

"Worst Retail Experience Ever . This has been my worst Retail experience ever. How do I get a hold of someone to rectify this when you have taken my payment for a product that I have never received? I am also the owner of a $50 cushion with no patio chair to put it on.

July 7 – ordered a patio chair and cushion. My credit card was charged.

July 12 – Waited at home on a Sunday for the delivery. Patio Chair and Cushion delivered. Driver did not bring items up to my condo so I lugged them up myself. When I got upstairs one item was not mine so I called delivery dispatch and had them come back. Carried item back downstairs and got correct item. When I opened the chair, the materials were unraveling. Packed the item back up and called IKEA customer service. 1 hour and 25m to get someone on the phone. New order for chair and pick-up of defective chair requested.

July 13 – Received 2 confirmation #’s for my new order and delivery date of July 20, 5-9 p.m. Also received a voice mail confirming this time and that the pick-up of the defective chair would be the day before or after. Then received confirmation of the defective chair pickup for July 21, 1-5:00. In the meantime I have had to store a very large box in my 650sf condo while waiting for this pick-up.

July 20th – Stayed home in the evening for my delivery of the new chair. There was no delivery. I called the delivery dispatch at 8 p.m. and they said the order had been cancelled. I was not aware of this or why that would be. No communication and IKEA has had my payment since July 7. I then tried to call IKEA customer service and got a message saying that the lines are too busy and to try another time.

I can appreciate and understand challenges with delivery, items being lost or life happening, but the utter disregard for customer experience in this case is very surprising for a company that I used to think took this type of experience seriously.

"Seriously deteriorated products and services . Used to like Ikea for all sorts of things but over the years have found quality deteriorating and the service is become just shocking. Most recently 2 terrible experiences that have left me an ex-customer
1) Wanted to replace an item we had that has just got past it used by date and has started to break apart - it was cheap so in itself not a drama. It becomes expensive though when you make the effort to go online and check stock levels and when the item is highlighted as green and in stock (not even yellow i.e. low stock) we drive the kms to the store only to find that they have none there - not 1…so from plenty of stock to none in 1 hour? Speaking to a ""Service"" person there we were told we should have CALLED the store before coming over - really!???
2) I received a $10 voucher for having spent in January - March. Got a ""reminder"" (noting this was the FIRST notification I had received) a week before it expired. Tried to order the item online (that was not in stock at the store we had just been to) the online checkout said it was not valid.
Tried to call the store - no answer.
Tried to use their online form - and noted the timeline - only to get no answer.
Tried again - noting the first enquiry to which I had no response…. (this is now after the voucher expired) - finally get an answer 19 days after I first tried to get help to be told ""We provide a voucher each quarter via email to your email address and you then have 3 months to use this voucher.
Once this period has expired we can no longer honor this voucher.""
Clearly they did not read my first, or even second contact ion any meaningful way so I respond to cancel my Ikea Family membership and have all my details removed from their system.

"AWFUL ""Customer Service"" . I ordered a Closet Unit and 3-tiered Cart on 5/22 and scheduled my delivery for 7/3 when I originally placed the order.

I took a day off of work to ensure I was home for the deliver which is stated to be between 9AM - 9PM. I got 3 emails (1 the week before, and 2 the morning before) stating that my delivery would arrive on 7/3.

On the morning of 7/3, I called the Delivery Company (Select Express & Logistics) to see if they had a more accurate time for my delivery (morning, afternoon, or evening). I was not told until that morning that my ordered had arrived from Ikea to their location the day before and DID NOT make it on the truck to be delivered on 7/3.

I was immediately angry because I had gotten several reminder emails from Ikea saying everything was on track and to expect my delivery on 7/3. When I talked to the Delivery Company they said I wouldn't get it until Monday 7/6. I argued with them for a while and then asked who would be refunding my delivery fee, paying my lost wages for taking the day off because you have to be there to accept your delivery, or who they were going to pay OT to in order to ensure my delivery made it to my house either on 7/3 or 7/4. They wouldn't help and wouldn't let me speak to a Supervisor. They told me to call Ikea.

So I called Ikea and got transferred to the ""after sales customer service team"". The woman was awful - wouldn't listen, wouldn't help and I asked her all of those same three questions above. She also wouldn't let me speak to a Supervisor. She said there was no way that they would refund my delivery fee or do anything else I asked. So basically they were going to do nothing for me - No Customer Service! She said I didn't have to take the day off of work because they call to give you a window time. Really? Because I had to call on that morning just to be told that my order wasn't even coming until Monday, July 6th!

Why does Ikea allow you to pick your delivery date on their site when you order a product from them IF THEY AREN'T GOING TO DELIVER ON THAT DAY - AND SOMEONE HAS TO BE HOME THAT IS OVER 18! If there was a back up or any type of issue due to COVID then call me and let me know that you need to reschedule so that I don't lose wages! I shouldn't have to call you just to be told that they aren't delivering. I would've NEVER known they weren't coming on 7/3, had I not called that morning to find out when my delivery was supposed to arrive (morning, afternoon, or evening). It was the WORST ""Customer Solutions"" experience EVER!

Seriously, rent a U-Haul and go to the store to pick it up yourself. It's not worth the large delivery fee and bs that you go through just to get the order on time after waiting OVER A MONTH! I could've gotten it MUCH SOONER and not went through all this bs!",Trustpilot_USA

There was NO ONE on the calls for customer service. Finally two weeks ago (a month from when i ordered) they said it would be delivered July 11th. But nothing has been processed yet. I have no faith that it will be delievered by Saturday the 11th. I specifically ordered this for a few summer gatherings (including a graduation). IKEA fell off in the worst way. And I hope it goes down for it. Covid hit EVERYONE, yet most companies made the adjustments....and customer service logged in from home. if you're not going to be able to ship the product, why are you still selling? Why have online commerce? It doesn't make any sense and i'm beyond pissed!!!",Trustpilot_USA
"I will never order from IKEA online again. . I ordered over $500 worth of merchandise from IKEA online. They were quick to process my order and assigned a delivery date for a week later with a 12 hour window. I received a confirmation email with all the details. The delivery day came and went without a word from IKEA. I phoned promptly at 930a this morning and was put through the phone tree, was advised I'd be transferred to an agent and then was cut off. I phoned back, went through the tree, was put on hold for 10min and then got an agent. She advised me my my order was never delivered because all items are out of stock. Because it was before 10a EST she advised that I had to call back later to get more information or reschedule delivery. Ridiculous that this is their process. I phoned back at 10a and got an automated message advising that my call could not be completed. I tried again and received another message advising that due to high inquiry volumes they cannot take calls at this time. I tried five minutes later and was given the same message. I understand that COVID has thrown business into a tailspin, but the response to problems is what defines your customer service. This is appalling. Ikea were quick to take my money and then provide no updates or adequate assistance.
UPDATE 7/20/20 : After several attempts and alot of time spent, I was able to get through to someone to cancel my order. The refund took 2 weeks.
They've lost me as a customer.",Trustpilot_USA
"Ireland (South East) Online order delivered without issue. . Ireland (South East) - Ordered a bunch of stuff online 27/June, with planned delivery date of Sunday 05 July 2020 07:00 - 13:00. It arrived on schedule, 12:30pm. No emails/texts from IKEA until 7am on the day of delivery, which is counter to the 1-2 days prior notice of the delivery slot that IKEA states in their initial order email. I was getting worried there was no notifications from them, and even more worried when I saw all the 1 star reviews of delivery problems when I started googling, so I'm just posting this review to tell people not to panic if you don't get notifications.

"Great product, awful service . I ordered 20 wardrobe doors with soft close hinges. I received the 20 doors, but only received enough hinges for 15 of the doors. I also received 5 packages of Besta hardware that I did not order. My guess is that 5 of my hinge sets were sent to someone who ordered 5 Besta cabinets and I got 5 sets of their hardware. Anyway, I tried several times to contact IKEA on the customer service number and my call was refused when I used the menu directions for delivery problems. So I used the menu item for new orders and customer service immediately answered my call. I reported the problem to the representative and she transferred me and I was on hold for 30 minutes. Then someone picked up and I told them about the problem and they put me on hold for another 15 minutes. Finally they said they would send me 5 more sets of hinges. So now, having waited a month to get my doors, I will now wait another 3 weeks to have my order completed. Some companies are thriving during this COVID crisis and others are using it as an excuse to give poor service. I can report to you that IKEA falls into the latter category.",Trustpilot_USA

"Well . Well, I wish I had read these reviews before hand. I will never shop at IKEA and will never order again. I ordered a comforter on the 5th and it was scheduled for the 29th. That was bad, but I figured with COVID19, it was understandable. I needed it by the 3rd of the following month. It is now the 4th and I still have not received it. So, on their track process it says being picked. It takes days for that process to be completed. It's a blanket! Either somebody is going to get the order or they are not. It doesn't take 2-3 days to find a blanket. Next your order is being prepared. Apparently it takes a few days for that as well... boxing a blanket. What, does Ikea do; chop the tree and process the wood to make cardboard on site before they can make a box? Next, it has shipped, as of the 26th... yeah! Only when checking tracking as of the 4th, it still shows they are creating a label, so it hasn't shipped, and apparently they need to chop down another tree to make the paper for the label. Horrible company to order from! Never again. Nebraska Furniture Mart is the way to go. I should have stuck with them.",Trustpilot_USA

Avoid Completely . I am disabled. I went to the MONS Store in Belgium. I left my wheelchair in England. They made me walk more than 100mtrs and when I asked to use one of their chairs they wanted photo-id. I did not have and they laughed at me. Their best price for a sofa was E900. I bought better elsewhere for E650. I emailed them and they ignored me. IKEA is history for me.,Trustpilot_USA
"So, bad I purchased elsewhere . Ikea doesn't seem to get it as a company. People want to be able to order on website and then pickup, yet Ikea doesn't offer its Click&Connect. It makes no sense why they're forcing customers to go into the store to make a purchase, especially when they have had the months of April, May, June to make adjusts (+3 months if anyone is counting). More than 3 months and yet they can't get their act together. I was going to purchase 2 stefan chairs and chair pads ($70?). Honestly, I feel that is overpriced, but whatever. When trying to order on website it won't let me place the order for Click&Connect pickup at store, or for delivery. So, instead I went to my local Costco type warehouse store and got 2 chairs I like for $44.

The only way this behavior on Ikea's part makes any sense logically is: they just don't care about us customers. They could of easily setup a store pickup system in 3 months and hired extra people for it. They just don't care about their customers, or our business. They are making the assumption that the people who are super loyal to Ikea will keep going there, no matter what.",Trustpilot_USA

Also Placed an $800 order that was estimated to be delivered June 25th and haven't received any notification for delivery on these items either. Attempting to call or email is impossible IKEA Does not even give you the option to speak with someone directly over the phone and the only thing you can email about is canceling an order. So now we have no choice but to cancel our $800 order. Even considering the times IKEA should still have some way to get in contact with someone or keep you informed if your delivery will be delayed.

I said I would like to make a complaint about not being informed of the delay and also about not being able to get through to customer service and they said that such a complaint would ""according to their strict matrix"" merit a 20 euro voucher but could not be further investigated.

I had to wait over 50 minutes to be connected with someone on Ikea Chat who had a very delayed response time (almost 6-7 minutes each response) only to find out I had to be transferred to ""after sales"" department.

"Dont order online ! . Dont order online !
On the 21/03/2020 I have placed an order with 30 items from IKEA.

Since then, they cancelled 2 deliveries and changed my order 11 times without consulting me. I have contacted them a dozen times to fix it, spending more than 10 hours on webchat/calls with their agents ( and queues were/still crazy to get to speak with someone from customer service), once after 2hrs wait and 4 hours hold the agent just hang up!!!!). At one time they’re going to send me shelves and doors for a wardrobes I will never receive-since they deleted them from my order.

From late May, I started to receive the items, at the time of writing I have had four deliveries, two were of duplicate items and after all of that I’m still missing a shoe cabinet, this Includes today’s delivery, which I had to reject since I already told customer service that I have the items and I want to return the duplicate ones they sent. Of course, they have failed to inform the courier about the collection and my tiny place’s corridor is another IKEA store at the moment!
My complaint is not about the delivery- we are going through a pandemic and totally understand that.

Majority of the drivers we nice and helpful..it’s customer service that keep messing about in the backrooms, at one intense an agent told me my order was modified by a ‘ higher authority’ and he couldn’t undo that or go against management decisions. I clearly told them I don’t mind waiting as long I’m getting my items but receiving duplicates cluttering my limited space and no help from customer service is stressful and I wouldn’t recommend anyone to order form their until they get themselves together.

After three hours wait.. I have been told by the agent I will be contacted to arrange the collection when the local store is open…it has been open since the beginning of the month, which he replied they don’t have permission to collect contradicting the statement from the last agent.

"Ridiculous service . I have placed an online order on 7th of June with a promised delivery date of June 9th. I also booked an assembly service for 15th of June. This is what happened afterwards:

- On June 9th, nothing arrived and nobody contacted me. I chatted with customer service and they said they could not do anything and I have to wait for Amsterdam IKEA to contact me! Since I had no idea when my order would arrive, obviously I had to re-book the assembly to a later date, which I did (27th of June)

- My order arrived 1 week after the promised date. However, two items were missing, including a big working desk! Of course the delivery guys had no idea about it, it is not their fault so they couldn't help me.

- I contacted customer service again. We booked the delivery of the remaining two items for Monday 22nd of June between 9.00 - 16.00

- On Monday 22nd of June, around 15.30, I received a message saying that my order has been cancelled and they can not deliver that day. How the **** does my order get cancelled without me knowing, I have no idea!!!!!!

- I kindly asked if I could add an item to my order (since it had arrived yet) and my request was rejected. I had to re-book the delivery for Wednesday 24th. Finally the two missing items arrived on that day.

- The website states that I would have been contacted half an hour before the delivery of my orders but I was contracted in neither of the 2 orders I received. As you can guess, I am working from home and I had to step out of 2 different calls due to IKEA delivery!!!!! If I had known what time they would arrive, I would have arranged my schedule accordingly.

- Now it's 27th of June, I was supposed to have assembly service today but I have no idea if they will come or at what time they will pop up. I can not reach customer service, I am tied to my house, having to wait for the slim chance that somebody shows up. This is ridiculous!

However they aren’t even open after 6 so how was I able to schedule this pickup? They have not sent me any emails to update me on my order, I spent 1/2 hr on hold with customer service only to give up. Now I check the status page and it says it’s in transit but I did not ship these items.

Not sure what to do as they only have one customer service line and you cannot directly call any of their locations which is beyond dumb. Now during covid I’m going to have to risk my safety to go down to IKEA just to see what is going on with my order.

All other companies have offered free pickup and often given deals on shipping.... not IKEA. They kept their doors open till the very last possible second, putting countless lives at risk all to make a buck.

People shop here because there quite frankly are no other affordable options....so this greedy, unscrupulous company is able to rack in the $$$ offering nothing but crappy customer service and cheap, overpriced products you assemble yourself with a great deal of effort and frustration.

The WORST, I don't even know how it is possible to have this bad service proposition on an e-commerce without bankrupting in 2020? Ordered some IN STOCK items 3 weeks ago. They were supposed to be delivered today, yeah long time to wait but thought it is fine. Looked at the order today and it has not even been picked??? No information about this was shared with me whatsoever. Waited a long time to talk to customer service the answer was: oh yeah we are behind on deliveries it will take at least a week more but cannot really say, you will receive a tracking code when its send. How is it even possible that company does not know when already paid customer orders (on stocked items) are being send? So now I just keep waiting, without any idea when these items might arrive. LAST ORDER OR PURCHASE IN IKEA. Will rather pay more to use someones else's services.",Trustpilot_USA

"IKEA DUBLIN . IKEA DUBLIN

Waited all day yesterday for order to arrive, as per the delivery information. It didn't arrive, and it was literally impossible to get in touch with anyone. Even during the opening hours listed on the website, the contact centre is closed.

Returned from shopping today and found half of the order dumped outside my flat, just off a main road. Some items were missing. I have no idea whether this means that items were stolen, or whether they only delivered half. Again, literally no way to contact them.
Don't make the mistake of buying online from them.

They also seem to be using covid restrictions as an excuse to have no form of customer service operating, or any way to contact them. Covid restrictions are not an excuse for appalling management and organisation, nor do they prevent emails being answered.

If I could give them zero stars, I would. This is the last time I shop with them.

"Poor Customer Service . You never realize the strength of a company until you need to resolve an issue. We ordered a couch on 4/28/20 with an anticipated delivery date of 5/24/20. Once that date passed we started calling customer service. This number was a consistent dead end with a computerized voice stating to ""call back later"". It wasn't until 5/29/20 that we pressed 1 for ""place a new order"" and of course, received a live person. This person internally transferred us to a customer service associate, who explained an error occurred on their end, and even though our credit card was billed for $1,500 on 4/28/20, the order was never placed. When the associate went to re-place the order, we were told the couch was now sold out. The associate told us our credit card would be credited for the $1,500 within a week of the call, which would have been June 5th. Here we are June 12th and I still have not received a credit. I've continued to call customer service and still receive dead ends. My tactic of trying to place a new order no longer works as well.

"How does it make any sense that I have… . How does it make any sense that I have to pay DKK 49 to pick up something from an IKEA warehouse? If I physically go to the warehouse and waste multiple employees' time and my own time waiting for the order to be ready for pickup, then it's for free.

But if I waste noone's time and order the items online for pickup in an IKEA warehouse, then I have to pay extra?

Where is the logic? How does it cost IKEA more that a customer orders and pays for the order online and then picks it up when the order is ready, rather than going there physically and having an employee order the item from the back shelves and then waiting in line?

You could use these fees to make more effective use of your employees' time. No rather, it should be opposite: It should cost NOTHING to order a pickup form the IKEA website, but there should be a fee to order it in the warehouse. Both with Covid-19, but also generally, customers ought to be nudged into using self-service at ikea.com instead of wasting your own employees' precious time.",Trustpilot_USA
"Careless . Bought a lovely lounge from Ikea yesterday from the As-Is section. There was damage on the underside but I was still happy with lounge and the discounted price, even after paying $69 for
delivery and an extra $25 for wrapping. The plastic bubble wrapping seemed perfect as the lounge would be stored under a carport for five days then transported for 90 minutes to its new home in the back of a Ute. I arrived from work this afternoon to find the lounge had been delivered completely unwrapped. The delivery guy knew nothing about it (he’s just a contractor) when my mother asked him why it wasn’t wrapped. I phoned IKEA with the given reference number and was on the phone for exactly 30 minutes, on hold for most of this time. The call centre guy spoke with IKEA and said that they could offer a refund and the mistake probably happened because they are very busy. Not good enough. Put on more staff- there are so many people wanting a job. He said someone would call me within the next 48 hours.
Unbelievable. Wrapping is part of their policy if the item is not boxed! The docket would show I paid for wrapping. I am on my way home from my second shift and am holding my breath, hoping there is no damage when I check it tomorrow. Moving is stressful enough without this carelessness.",Trustpilot_USA

"GDPR Claim . I will be filing a complaint with the information commissioner regarding a breach of GDPR. This will be directed to both IKEA in the UK and IKEA global.
As someone placing a first furniture order, Ikea had the opportunity to generate lifelong business. I was placing a large order which I received an order number for but no confirmation email. I spoke with Josh on webchat who advised that he couldn't find my order. I asked why I had an order number had been created if no order had been placed, which he was also unable to advise me on.
I asked that since they had caused many problems with my delivery date and the move into my new property, could they change the date of the second order to the original date I was given. They advised that I shouldn't place a second order in case the first one actually goes through. I advised Josh that this won't be an issue as the second order can be refused under the unsolicited goods act or canceled as per the consumer rights act. He wasn’t able to help me with this wish is an appalling display of customer service, since this causes me major issues with my move.
I requested that I receive a copy of our chat (which I wasn't given the opportunity to do afterward) which was refused to do. He made a claim with their resolutions team and as per my rights, I requested a copy of this too, which he refused and then proceeded to send me some text that he had typed up but no copy of the claim.

Soonest delivery by truck was 1+ month out.

After trying phone customer service for three days, finally reached a human who put me on hold and never came back (waited for a half hour). I love IKEAs products, but I will never buy IKEA again. Shocking that such a large international retailer is so utterly ill-equipped. Even on a good pre-pandemic day IKEA's prehistoric website functionality and ""Where's Waldo?"" customer service make it hard to spend your money at IKEA.

"Worst Experience Ever! If you value your money, do not shop there. . If you don't want to have money taken from you for a month, don't shop there. Ikea borrows your money for a month and returns it to you, with 0% interest, only after you wait hours to talk to them and ask for a refund. Zero respect for customers, absolutely horrendous customer service! I will NEVER shop there again.

I placed an order on 29 April 2020 and got an email saying that it would be delivered 3 days later. 2 days later I get an SMS saying ""your order will be delivered tomorrow between 7am and 11am"". The following day at 2pm, nothing had arrived. I get in touch with Ikea through their web chat. They say the order will come. Still nothing.
The following day I request a call back, and 30min later a man with an unintelligible accent rings me. He says my order didn't come because one item was not available. (But they couldn't have let me know the day before, of course not! Why let me know if they can make me sit and wait all day like a moron?). He then reschedules my order for the 25th of May - yes, 3 weeks later, and Ikea refunds me for that item 4 days later.

On the 20th of May I get an email saying that my order had been cancelled. No explanation, no excuses, nothing. Just - your order has been cancelled. I try to get in touch with them but the buttons for the web chat and call back are inactive. Their website randomly activates these buttons, so you have to keep refreshing every 5 min until you hit lucky. I was finally able to request a call back on the 27th of May. They rang me and - surprise! - I pick up and they stay silent, then hang up on me. Hours later I was able to request another call back, and this time a lady rings me and I am able to explain the problem. She then says I will get my refund within 7 days and they would send me an SMS confirming that the refund had been authorised. I had to check the amount, because they were not refunding the delivery charge!! If I hadn't told them that I wanted the 49 euro back as well, they wouldn't have refunded me for it.

So I have two tips:
1) If you are thinking of shopping there, think again. We were able to buy everything we wanted from other shops and get everything delivered within 1 week after all this Ikea nonsense. Ikea basically borrowed our money for a month.

2) If you have done the same mistake I have and are trying to get in touch with them but having difficulties, I have found a loop hole on their website. Using Safari on a Mac (I don't know whether this works for other browsers), you keep refreshing the contact page until you see the button for a call back activated. After you request a call back, simply hit ""back"" on your browser, and you will go again to the page where you can enter your phone number to request another call back. So no more refreshing-for-hours-like-an-idiot, just ask for another call back if they take more than say 20min to ring -- or if they hang up on you.",Trustpilot_USA

Somehow managed to get through the phone support to a customer care operator and got the following explanation: some of the items were out of stock on the delivery date, but now they are back in stock, so I should expect a notification they are out of the warehouse for delivery soon. No clarification on when the ""soon"" is: days, weeks, months... I did not receive any update from them and opened a dispute with my credit card company effective May 28th 2020. Got an update from IKEA with new delivery notification on May 31 2020.

Without any transparency from their side and with close to ZERO possibility of reaching the customer support my intuition says that they don't want to go through their backlog trying to serve current customers first.

First of all it would be MUCH better if IKEA charged you only when items are ready to be shipped. Considering the current situation I would not mind waiting much longer for the stuff to be delivered if they would have communicated it clearly. Instead I feel like I was just lending money to a multi-billion for-profit corporation for an unknown time without any interest rate and zero accountability from their side.",Trustpilot_USA

So how is it that a huge otherwise well organized company like IKEA, get lost ""in a glass of water"". WHO decides this could not be done, the CEO, really? AND WHY? Does he decide these operational details? Or is it the tech programmers? WHO and WHY does a global IKEA get bogged down with these minor details that would benefit itself AND the customers. If you're in the business of selling, WHY do you create senseless obstacles to the sales. I'm not an economist, just a customer with some common sense.

To get all I wanted to be delivered to my home I'd have to go to the store in Dublin and pay in there for the stuff. I leave in Cork though. I know it sounds ridiculous but that's true.
I bought what was available online in Ireland and next day I went to Ikea Poland webside and bought another part (approx half of what I initially wanted) online in there. The parcel from Poland was sent to my polish home address, then picked up by national couriers and sent to international couriers depot and finally send to my home address in Ireland.
I got it yesterday.
I'm still waiting for the part bought in Ireland and it was supposed to be here 2 days ago. Unable to contact them as due to Covid19 all phone numbers are switched off.

"The experience itself is as low quality as the goods they sell. . I placed my order with Ikea on 4/18/20 understanding that COVID-19 has vastly effect e-commerce. To be honest, I'd be fine with the delay if I didn't notice other retailers basically continuing business as usual. I ordered from another retailer and after reaching out they told me that delays in France where manufacturing has been halted was the reason for the delay which I fully understand. Ikea has closed down all of its communication with customers. I understand furloughing people, but I am certain this kind of work can be done from home -- responding to customers over email. Or better yet, a single mass email to all open orders explaining the situation. Instead, I waited 6 weeks before I got an update -- that my order had shipped. However, it's been 5 days since that email, and FedEx's portal says the label has been created but not sent out... WHY?!? Post memorial day, it should be shipped by now (Wednesday). All routes on the phone (1,2,3, etc) lead to being disconnected, the only kind of response you can submit online is to cancel your order, and that's been the experience thus far. All I ordered were some aluminum shelving for my cabinets and a pack of tea towels... I didn't even order large furniture. If I didn't already have some of those shelves I'd replace them with the container store which although delayed got my order to me in 4 weeks.

Why don't tell me it was not available when I was looking at the item like other stores do? Why can't it just place my order ""on back order""? why do I have to try again_ waste my time_ instead of them filling my order when available? -- Not efficient. Not convenient.

OK a week later I tried again. It had my items available. I placed the order. I was excited to finally finish my home office.... Well....hold your excitement!!~!! Because 1 week before I was to received my items -- it was canceled. ""It simply canceled the order period. no explanation,. was not available"" . Here is you money back and try again later!!! AGAIN! here goes more of my time--- Not Convenient!!! Also the other items were delayed 10 days!!!

Now, I learned that I can order and pick it up at the local store in Colorado. I was all excited. I read I could order, pay and it would schedule a pick up for me.
I can see they have my item but again only when i get to the payment part of the process it is telling me that the ""Location I need.... exceeded the amount of orders"" TRY TOMORROW. What is wrong with these people???

Why can't you just fill my order and let me know when it is available to pick up??? like it said it would?? why is this so inconvenient???

So I called.... and I get a machine who tells me ""Sorry but we are overwhelmed and can't take you call!"" Is this for real????

My understanding is that IKEA is an European store and I can't believe that Europeans would put up with this bad of a service.

Please fix it. There are plenty of e commerce websites who do a fantastic job at websites and delivery. Ordering through the internet is not a ""new thing"".

I think everyone knows by now that we're in a very complex situation and companies are under a ton of pressure to fulfill orders and meet demand....yet somehow every other company I've ordered from online has been able to meet some kind of service standard. IKEA is clearly just letting all its customers down from what I'm seeing. I mean first off, maybe you need to give customers a heads up when they order that they will be waiting 6+ weeks for delivery and maybe don't charge customers until you actually fill the order. IKEA's customer service right now, is NON-EXISTANT. Chat always full- can't even get in the queue and the call centre just disconnects you after you've been waiting. Maybe they need to re-evaluate the order system instead of just piling on the orders and back-logging their warehouse. They're just racking up the orders so they collect as much money as possible before their entire system crashes. Good job.",Trustpilot_USA

Our delivery time came and passed on this date and when we call, their outsourced delivery call center let us know that it was now delayed until 5/15/20. Today, our items were finally out for delivery and then during our scheduled delivery time the order was cancelled. Ikea emailed us for the first time stating the delivery was cancelled due to broken or missing items. Our new delivery date is 5/26/20, but I am sure there will be more delays as it seems to be common. Ikea's call center is overloaded and impossible to get through, they simply hang up.

"Disaster. Do. Not. Buy. Terrible Customer Service. . In March, I ordered a sofa and a few other items and was given a delivery date of mid-April. Come mid-April, the delivery came, only to receive HALF of a couch. Since the couch is modular, the half of a couch I do have is missing legs on one side and has metal connectors visible. Terrible and dangerous! But that's not all. After countless promises for call-backs and warehouse searches, no one ever followed up. Finally I was able to get a supervisor, who offered to refund the delivery fee and the part of the couch that wasn't delivered. Like that was making it right... I was told I could order it once it came back into stock. So I did (after getting the refund 3 weeks later). I ordered the couch, which said it would be delivered in a week. Four days later, after I called to double-check, they said my order was cancelled (no email/update online). Why? Because Ikea didn't receive my payment. Even though my bank account showed that had been pulled (the full delivery and all). After checking with a manager, they found out my CC was charged and that it was cancelled due to a ""technical glitch"". Kicker is, the couch is now out of stock! So I'll get a refund in 3 weeks and still half a couch! I will never ever shop at Ikea again. There is no sense of customer service at this company and their order system clearly doesn't work.

"Cancelled an order without telling me and offered a ridiculous new delivery date. . While I would not call going into the store to make purchases a bad experience, ordering from them online is not a good option. I have had 3 online delivery orders with them and one for in-store pick up. They deliver things open and unprotected, which the delivery people have even called crazy. The in-store pickup has some policies that are not consumer friendly. The main reason I'm writing this though is the 3rd online order from them, which will be my last. I ordered from them on April 11th for a May 11th delivery date. one item was out of stock, which they notified me about on May 8th. What they did not say is they canceled the order as a result and created a new one without a delivery date. The order was not showing up on the website so I called them. They offered a delivery on June 28th. I declined and they said they would have the refund to me in about 10 days (most place do a 2-3 maximum). Every other company I have worked with makes a point to make things right quickly. Offering a delivery over 6 weeks later after you have already waited 4 weeks is by no means reasonable, at least to me and my experience in customer service.",Trustpilot_USA
"Ikea bunch of Liars . Ordered items, paid extortionate delivery cost and chose date of delivery. As all the reviews, my delivery also did not show up. As all Ikea phone lines are closed, i had to wait on a chat portal, which in total wasted nearly 6 hours of my time. 1st individual i spoke to Muhammed.
Hadn't a clue what day of the week it was. 
Asked when my parcel would arrive, he left the conversation. 
Waited again to speak to someone. This time it was someone called Katie.
She advised it should be delivered and gave me a telephone number to call. I called the number whilst chatting to her, and the recorded message stated we are unable to support you through this channel. Basically meaning the phone lines are closed, which is what it states on their website. When i advised Katie of this, she stated, the phone line is open and it stops taking calls because too many people are in the queue. What a lie. When pushed for confirmation of delivery and the complaints process and details, again she also ended the chat and left.
Finally spoke to 3rd joker called Janet. Who again could not give a straight answer when i asked if she could provide me with the tracking number of my order. I stated, the ikea online tracker is inaccurate. She stated DPD are having tech issues, therefore their info is not coming through to ikea and they do not have any details. But she was able to confirm, the item is loaded on the truck and assured me if an item is loaded then this means it will be delivered on the day. I spoke to DPD, who can search if they have an item for you by name and address, confirmed they have no delivery or tech issues. 
You've guessed it, No Delivery and no apology or call or email to advise of delays from ikea. If you can't operate during this lockdown, then stop trading. Letting so many people down who are keeping themselves occupied by renovating/decorating their home and using ikea the Not So Wonderful Everyday! to do this.

Okay maybe fair enough, so I asked them to update the phone number on the order to my number and rescheduled the delivery for 8th May. Due to some system error, the delivery company didn't get the message, so again it didn't turn up. I then spoke to another person and arranged delivery directly with the delivery service for 11/05. I didn't get a call with a four hour window the day before so I call up today and turns out they called the wrong number AGAIN and cancelled the delivery because no one answered.

"Shocking service recovery . My girlfriend made an online order for us. She drove out to the IKEA Taastrup where we ordered from and was told our order had been cancelled, recreated and cancelled again (I suspect a member of staff didn't fancy picking so many items) my partner asked how this was possible as the only information she had received was an order confirmation and instructions for us to go and collect our order.

She came home empty handed. After chatting to web chat she was instructed to call customer services. Customer services told her after a lengthy call that they had agreed for our order to be picked with the store and we could collect it after the next day. We have a newborn baby and were in the middle of moving so our time is limited and we were counting quite heavily on getting the curtains from our order to help put the baby down to sleep in the dark.

We also specifically chose online picking to avoid crowds (due to the virus) and to save time.

Next it was my turn. I drove again to IKEA early on Sunday morning to collect our order and made sure I arrived early enough (09:40) to be the 2nd car waiting outside the collection point.

IKEA staff came strolling out of the building around 10:15 and began dealing with the first car at least 20 mins after the supposed opening time. When it was my turn I was asked to wait in bay 1. I did so and after 10 minutes I was told very quickly through my car window that I needed to go to the returns section of the store to collect my order, and they had nothing to do with it (even though 10 minutes earlier they took the code customer services gave to my gf for our newly recreated order). At this point I was beginning to get very frustrated, it was weekend and the number of cars in the parking lot indicated there would be a lengthy queue.

The returns section was cordoned off due to the virus and I could see that only 1 or 2 people were being allowed down into the returns section at a time. I explained to the member of staff on the door my situation. This was the only member of staff of the 10 that I, or my partner dealt with who showed any real empathy to my story and situation. He let me go down, avoiding a queue that looked like it would take at least 45 minutes to get through.

Downstairs I spent 30-40 minutes with an angry, uninformative member of staff who made phone call after phone call. Always out of hearing distance for me and who told me multiple times ""it's busy""""you will have to pick your order yourself"" ""I don't know where your order is"". It was quite clear once I was asked to leave the collection point that my order had never been picked.

When you pay for a service you expect it to be delivered and if not at least a satisfactory answer to why what should be a standard business practice of order picking could go so wrong. If you're staff had any proper training then a simple apology, explanation of the error and some form of compensation would have kept me a happy customer. Instead her and others lack of empathy and desire to take responsibility to do this only fuelled my frustration more. I can see now that I am not the only one who has received such a shocking level of service so it is clear IKEAs promise to pick and deliver orders for such a low fee clearly backfired and fatigue set in for staff.

In the end I got a refund for the exact amount of our order, so I could go and pick my order myself and a measly 300 kr compensation for 2 wasted car trips and approx 8 hours of our time split over multiple days wasted not being able to collect the order as intended.

We arranged for it to be collected and the right one delivered, however on the morning the delivery was due we had a phone call cancelling it due to the coronavirus measures.

When I checked online it said they were still delivering and indeed they were tweeting people to say they were still fulfilling orders - clearly not the case! When I finally managed to get hold of someone they said my item had been cancelled because it wasn’t an online order. Of course it was an online order as I’d ordered it from the website, however apparently exchanges need to be done via a store.

So even though it was their mistake in the first place they were unable to assist and said that the only option would be to wait until lockdown was over and they could deliver the correct item.

This wasn’t acceptable to me, I needed the item for a nursery, there was no good them exchanging in a couple of months time when the baby is already here, meanwhile having space taken ho with the incorrect item.

After a lot of arguing they agreed they would refund me the difference between the two items and I could just keep the original incorrect item. This wasn’t great as I’d already paid the extortionate £40 for delivery of the wrong item, but it seemed like that was the best we would get.

Of course surprise surprise the money has never actually materialised. I was assured it would be refunded within two weeks. After three weeks I got in touch again and got told it was stuck in a queue but would be processed in 3-5 days. Fast forward another week, still no money. Get in touch again and told it would be another 3-5 days. Surprise surprise 3-5 days later and still no money!!! They have now messaged me on Twitter asking me to ring them so they can manually process the refund - god knows how long it will take to get through and again I probably still won’t actually receive the money.

I appreciate companies are under pressure with coronavirus but it is still not acceptable to just keep hold of someone’s money when you are not able to deliver them the goods. Ironically I could quite easily order the correct item online and pay another £40 for delivery, yet they won’t deliver the correct item to me as they say they can’t currently collect the incorrect one. Little more than thieves!",Trustpilot_USA
"Do not waste your time or money! . I spent 40 minutes on hold to the IKEA webchat for an analyst to not respond my to query, she explained to me that my order was ready to be collected for An Post, I asked for a tracking number and she never replied. After waiting 30 minutes I ended the chat and waited back in the queue for 20 minutes to talk to another analyst. This analyst cancelled my order without my permission and I received an email with a credit invoice that I will now not get for 10+ working days. I am livid. I waited 1 full month for my order for it to not arrive on the set date and then for it to be cancelled without my permission. Had to wait another 20 minutes to talk to another analyst to try revoke this cancellation to be told that they can do this but the 3 main items I ordered were now out of stock and delivery will not be until mid June for the other items so I had to keep my refund as the order was pointless. Very similar experience as the review below! Will never buy from here again, worst customer service I’ve ever experienced.",Trustpilot_USA
"[Ireland] Disappointing service, I just lend my money to IKEA for 46+ days . [ireland] - Ordered a chair and a desk almost a month ago, was due to be delivered 20/04 during this waiting period it just sat there on ""preparing your order"" contacted the chat support multiple times and they kept saying that this was a system error but my order was being given to anpost for delivery so I should just wait, today 22/04 I got on the chat again to see if they had any update for me, and was told that due to an error in the system my order had to be cancelled, after a month, after a month of waiting, and to make things even worse the refund takes 14 days to process with no other way to track this process than getting into the chat again, so zero transparency and queues.

My takeaway here is, do-not order from Ikea, not now during this pandemic not after, there’s similar complaints here from way before, fragile systems, lack of transparency and if you don't go chasing them...
But most important if you have an order that seems to be blocked on a status, do something, cancel order somewhere else do not trust that they will do the right thing, i waited for a month with back pains and neck sore for working from home in a dining table and now they’re keeping my money for more 14 days and I'll have to find someplace else to order, so if you are not that eager to lend your money to ikea DO NOT SHOP HERE

My wife and I have been trying to order over 6K in Kitchen cabinets, but their service malfunctioned every time. We tried calling for over 2 weeks to get this sorted out and were told the only thing we can do is to start from scratch.. We did this, but every time we submitted our order the system would say 'This item is not available'. We deleted the item and tried again, BUT another item is now no longer available. I stubbornly continued until there was literally NOTHING available. Tried calling, but that doesn't do anything. Tried emailing, but you can't.. This story could and should be much MUUUCH longer, but to keep it short- DON'T SHOP HERE!.. I'm also a contractor with 3 kitchen and 2 bath remodels scheduled for the summer and we will definitely not be going with IKEA.

disgusting after sales . I will never go near this company again. I ordered from them around the beginning of April and cancelled a few hours later.

"IKEA - Feels Like a Scam . LONG STORY SHORT:
IKEA took my money over two weeks ago, failed to provide the product I paid for, and made it near impossible for me to get my money back. If I wasn't dealing with a large, established, and ""respectable"" company such as IKEA, I would feel like this was an attempted scam.

DETAILS:
This is the first time I have ever felt compelled to leave an online review for anything. The Customer Service experience I have just had is absolutely appalling. I am disgusted that a corporation as massive and profitable as IKEA are so wiling to screw their customers. I made an order on April 3rd. It is now over two weeks later and my order has not been delivered. When I check the status, it tells me my order is still in the ""Picking"" phase at the store. It has been in this status for the past two weeks.
So I decided to just cancel my order as I really can't afford to wait so long for something that has become an urgent necessity for me. However, when I called the store, the number was ""currently unavailable"". When I tried to use the online form, it would freeze and not allow me to submit. When I tried to use the online chat, it would tell me it was not available.
I finally managed to get through on chat today. I waited maybe 15 minutes in the ""queue"" which is completely understandable. However, when I did get through, the agent told me that it would take ""7-12 business days"" to issue a refund due to delays caused by COVID-19. I can certainly understand how COVID-19 might affect certain aspect of IKEA's operations (such as store opening hours and even delivery times), but I'm really at a loss to understand how issuing a refund would be affected. I mean, is this not an automated process? Do IKEA's staff physically go to the bank for cash and hand deliver my refund? If processing my payment isn't affected by COVID-19, then returning my money shouldn't be either.
In any case, I really had no choice but to accept the 7-12 business days for a refund and so asked the agent to proceed with cancelling my order. He then informed me that he would need to transfer me to his after sales team. He did so and I was alerted that I was number 1 in the queue and wait time was 5 minutes - fantastic! Except I was waiting as #1 in queue with a wait time of 5 minutes for 50 minutes. At a certain point the chat just timed out due to ""user inactivity"". So now I'm back at square one.
Undeterred, I begin a new chat. Again, I get through to an agent fairly quickly. But she also tells me that she needs to transfer me to the after sales team to process the cancellation and refund. I plead with her not to, but she clearly has no other recourse and so I am again transferred. Once again I am #1 in queue with a wait time of 5 minutes... and I have been that way for an hour.
I have now lost all hope of ever speaking to the mysterious after sales team who alone in all of IKEA have the authority to process a cancellation. I finally managed to use the online form to send an ""email"" request. Apparently, they will get back to me within 96 and 120 hours. Perhaps they will, but I am not hopeful.
Since writing the above and after an hour of waiting, I have finally managed to get through to an after sales agent on the chat. She informed me that my cancellation was processed and my refund would be issued within 5-10 business days. This is considerably less than the 7-12 business days the first agent told me about. Was his intention to discourage me from cancelling? Is this the company policy?
At this point, it goes without saying that I will never shop at IKEA again. COVID-19 has affected most businesses, but if the local shops in my area can set up online delivery platforms that are effective and fast within a matter of days, then IKEA, with its massive resources and infrastructure, should be able to process a simple order cancellation.",Trustpilot_USA
"Never again . I ordered some items almost 2 weeks ago and scheduled the delivery for the 11th of April. Of course the order didn't arrive so 1 hour before the deadline I opened a chat. I never ever experienced such a bad customer service. Odienne (the first agent I talked to) wasn't able to provide me a solution, moreover she made be late at work and I got deducted for that. She scheduled a callback for the when I was at work, although I told her that I will be unable, for that I can lose my job.

I talked to the callback agent, who made me be very late for work, her telling me that they can deliver the items on the 15th of April, after me repeating for the 5th time that I am not available. She asked me when I will be available again, I told her that on the 18th and that it's URGENT. She didn't care about this and her reply was simple and very sarcastic: 'I will reschedule your delivery for the day you will be available all day long'. I told her that I want to make a complaint and in a rude way she told me to do it on the website.

On the 15th of April I received an email saying that was order was successfully delivered. I NEVER EVER RECEIVED ANYTHING FROM THEM. So just to make sure, with my last hope, I opened a chat to make clear that my delivery wasn't shipped to a different person. I waited 15-20 minutes on the queue until the 'lovely' Beatriz answered me. I told her my issue which ended up with her closing the chat. I opened another chat, very angry for that and guess what! I caught our 'lovely' Beatriz again. I asked her to transfer me to a supervisor or to a different agent and tried to lie to me that she can't do that and that all of their chats were fallen and I told her to check the previous chat which happened 5 minutes ago if she wants to be helpful. When she refused I wanted to send her a screenshot from the so called previous 'chat' with her, to realize that she closed the chat again. When I wanted to open another chat, I saw that the chat button was not available anymore. Why? Because their customer service is open until 8 PM. Guess what! It was 8:03 PM but it was 7:36 PM when I opened the chat the first time. I sent another complaint and I know that I won't receive an answer again.

I would attach the screenshots of the chats to show everybody what 'great' customer service means. This will follow up with a complaint at the complaints book so that the authorities are aware of how the customers are getting screwed up and stolen by these kind of companies.",Trustpilot_USA

I order a sofa the FRIHETEN. I was VERY much looking forward to it. I selected the wrong color and called customer service immediately after I placed the order. I was told they can't cancel it but that I could return it for the other after it was delivered. Weird and annoying, but far from a deal breaker.

First , I'm told it's out for delivery. Then they I get a call (at the end of the delivery window) that their truck broke down.

I call Select Express directly and they schedule for next Thursday. Seven days later, (a week lost) because they say they only deliver to my area on that day. Thursday comes. I call that day, I get confirmation on delivery. They transfer me to their IKEA specialist, who hangs up on me. I call back, the specialist laughs at me and blames IKEA for ""choosing the wrong date"" when I called them directly. I call IKEA and they say they will refund for shipping for this horrible experience. That works for me, I am happy. They schedule for Monday.

The tracking number showed they loaded it at 10:30 AM on the truck for delivery. I follow the truck on the map on the Select Express tracking. It starts to get late. The map no longer loads. I call Select Express and they say they lost my couch in their warehouse and that they will call me when they find it. Even though it shows as being loaded on the truck. I call IKEA who calls Select Express, who tells IKEA ""we never got the couch from you"". A slightly different story.

I call IKEA. The first option is a full refund and a cancellation of the couch I really want. I go for it. Obviously its not possible to get this couch.

I message IKEA on Twitter, I'm told that my refund is in the ""final stages"" of being processed. I get refunded for the shipping. I message again. Nothing for several days until finally I'm told a glitch has caused them to only refund my shipping. I can expect the rest in the next few days.

How could I possibly ever recommend IKEA to anyone when I can't even get one sofa with my first experience with IKEA. I am so disappointed that I cannot get that amazing couch. I can't shop with IKEA ever again and will recommend others to do the same.

Ikea is focusing on the value its products bring to their consumers, not with just an affordable pricing structure. They've precisely pinpointed their cost structure in the sweet-spots of wallets. And to supplement that pricing, they give consumers a community to belong to with their open floorplans and a unique buying experience. It almost gives me a vision as to what a success story looks like, with seeing open housing concepts and being able to capture my own independence when I buy a home or condo, and begin to liven it up; just by walking around.

"Avoid this toxic company who hold their customers in contempt . IKEA Manchester overcharged us by £21.00. I only discovered this once we got home.

This was not welcome news as it meant a 1-hour round trip on a work evening which was highly inconvenient. I couldn't believe that they didn't have a better and more sophisticated system in place than looking on CCTV. Despite the frustration, we turned up to the store yesterday evening only to be told that they didn't gave any staff available to check the CCTV so couldn't issue a refund! I was furious and demanded to see the manager. The manager was devoid of any charm or pleasantness and told me it was their policy to check cctv first and that I wouldn't get a refund until the next day. We were given a case number and told we woukd receive a call once the refund was done. I made my frustration known and said I intended to complain. The manager looked totally unconcerned, and reading comments here I can see why. They basically couldn't care less because no one's going to do anything or take any action. I checked their website for their complaints procedure and there isn't even a complaints category included as far as I could see.

Not even an automated response came back telling me how long before I'd receive a reply. By 2.40 pm today, no one had called back so I contacted customer service again. After almost 40 minutes on the phone of stalling and being put on hold for ages several times, I put my foot down and finally got to speak to the manager. I was told he'd contact the store to get them to resolve it but there were all sorts of excuses given for their useless response. I told him I expected the refund to be sorted within the next hour as it was their error and I'd spent so long trying to get this resolved. I tweeted about their useless service on IKEA Support and got a quick public response asking me to DM them. I did this but they did nothing in response except give me another pointless reason for why they couldn't sort it out. So, merely a face-saving exercise in public, which is sheer hypocrisy. We are still awaiting the refund so the only route for us now is via our credit card company. I see that IKEA don't bother to respond to any of the many complaints on here which again just shows their contempt for their customers. With all their millions of profit, they still refuse to give us our £21 back that they took in error. It beggars belief. Truly, I never want to deal with this vile organisation again.

"We bought the PAX wardrobe set and a… . We bought the PAX wardrobe set and a mirror weeks ago and opted for home delivery. On the day it was meant to arrive, the delivery was towards the end of the window they gave us (we received no notice until they were almost at our door and thought they had missed our order). Some items were delivered damaged, including a smashed mirror and a broken PAX frame. The frame was ""dented"" in the sense that the laminate tore and the inside looked completely hollow. The delivery guy said our items were at the bottom of the truck, so that combined with it being late implied we were the last delivery of the day. They made a note of the damaged items and told us to wait for a call from IKEA. (A somewhat odd note was they refused to take the smashed mirror back, and just propped it against a wall by the kitchen, even though we had a cat who could get himself hurt with the exposed pieces.)
The call never came and several days later we decided to call IKEA ourselves. They don't tell you the wait-time would take hours. The agent told us they were low on stock and would have to call us back on Wednesday (which is a week later).
That call never came either, and on Thursday we called IKEA again, got put on hold for hours, only to be told by the agent that our case needs to be transferred to the after-sales department, which is unavailable currently due to ""high call volumes"".
We called once again on Friday, got put on hold again, got told by an agent again that he'd need to transfer us to the after-sales department, to which by the way there's no direct line, so you have to remain connected through two transfers and two queues or else your enquiries won't even reach a human being.
So after waiting another several hours and 29 other callers ahead of us, we got hold of an agent who, to add insult to injury, tried to offer us 20% discount to keep the broken wardrobe. When we told him no, he said he'd put through a replacement delivery scheduled next Sunday for 1-5pm.
Sunday 5pm passed as well, and on our final call to IKEA we were told the replacement order was never even processed by the system. The after-sales agent implied it took two days to process an order in their esoteric system, and they didn't even offer a way to notify us in the event of an order-processing failure, or somehow guarantee a delivery after everything.
We're left to wait another few days with now little confidence the delivery will ever actually arrive.

I told IKEA this and they invited me to send them his invoice indicating that they do offer reimbursements. But while they accepted the legitimacy of the builder's company, his tax status, and of the claim, they refused to pay the invoice on the grounds that his company is not VAT registered - a factor which is of course irrelevant to the claim.

IKEA customer service kept me holding and arguing with them for 4 hours 6:00pm till 10:00pm and be faced with these scammers on the counter that didn't want to return the sofa. why? because they said its used and i don't have the original packaging stating that they only take it if it is with the packaging to ""PUT BACK ON SHELF & SELL IT TO OTHER PEOLE"".

3. 365 days return policy!! hahahahahahahha tell this to someone that has no common sense. there will always be something that you will pull off not to return.

"IKEA.se scammed me into paying double delivery fee, then hijacked the furniture I already paid for . I ordered furniture for +8000 SEK for my house in Sweden from Ikea.se. The order was scheduled for delivery today. Nobody called me about the delivery and hours later I got an email saying the delivery could not be done and to call customer service.

From customer service I learned that - according to IKEA - the delivery driver had tried to call me once and I had not picked up. And they cancelled the delivery. If want a new delivery, I had to pay for deliver again.

First of all, I did not receive this call, despite the fact that Ikea confirmed that my number was correct. I was literally waiting for the phone to call and I can see in my call history that NO ONE tried to call me.

And now the very rude customer service representative requires me to pay again. I told her that wasn't fair since I didn't get the phone call and everything was ready for delivery. She finally told me that I wouldn't get delivery without paying for it again. And hung up on me without rescheduling another delivery, thus effectively hijacking my paid for furniture until I pay up.

Now I have the option to either 1) NOT get the furniture I've already paid for, or 2) pay double fee for delivery, without any guarantee that I'll actually get my furniture - because, as I learned from the customer representative, if the driver can't reach me again, they'll also cancel the second delivery. And so on.

I'm very surprised anyone choses to run a business this way in this day and age. The customer representative thought she was very generous and said Ikea could perhaps pay half the delivery fee, but it's not about the money, it's about what's right and fair. And so far, I've already paid 8000 SEK for nothing.",Trustpilot_USA

I paid over £100, delivery was promised for last Sunday. No delivery, just a message from the delivery company about a delay, with an update promised within 24 hours. No update. I raised an issue, the delivery company promised an investigation, since the parcel had kind of disappeared, result due within 3-5 working days, communicated to the sender, not me. But I was at least promised an 'initial update' within 24 hours. Then I contacted Ikea. They told me I just had to wait. I wanted to cancel the order, but was told this wasn't possible anymore since the items had been sent. Today, no 'initial update', nothing from Ikea either. They just leave me dangling. A good customer service would mean they either send the items again immediately, with me having to promise to send the first parcel back, in case it appeared again miraculously, and them sorting out the problem with the delivery company which, after all, they have chosen, or cancelling the order with a full refund. Instead, I have to wait a week, with no idea what will happen after that. I freely admit that I am a bit spoilt, being so impatient. But a customer-friendly company today simply delivers when promised or tries their utmost to remedy the situation if this does not happen and not just lets their customers wait. I have come to expect such a good service since most companies with online business offer it. Not Ikea, though. This will probably have been my last order with them, whatever happens with this package.

P.S. I finally got Ikea to send a replacement. But, lo and behold - the next day the lost parcel was obviously found again and finally delivered, after a short additional delay.

Then Christmas happened, so the next available Saturday, I was ready to put it together. However, it was completely damaged on every corner. I called customer services who said that they would send somebody to get it, on the next Saturday. I gave up 4 Saturdays for a table that I couldn't put up! No compensation offer, nothing. And still no table!",Trustpilot_USA
"UPDATE: IKEA came through! . Ikea is great to shop for affordable furniture and their furniture is durable. I own a few pieces and have recommended some to friends. When my son and daughter-in-law were visiting over Thanksgiving I took them to the Columbus, OH store where they purchased a table top and 4 table legs. They were moving to a new apartment in January - 6 hours away in Michigan. When they moved in to their apartment, they attempted to assemble their table but one of the legs had a manufacturing defect and would not thread. We called the Columbus store and at first were told that we could return the $4.00 leg and get a replacement. My son explained they were 6 hours away from where they purchased it. He was told there was a store in Canton MI, but of course that was a mere 4 hours away. It would be highly inconvenient for them to make the 4 hour trip for a $4.00 leg, could they please send a new one? He said he was willing to pay for a new leg, he just didn't want to pay the shipping. I could return the defective one if necessary when I returned to Ohio. The CS representative told him she could not do that, so he asked for a supervisor. After some discussion, the supervisor appeared to understand the dilemma and appeared to want to help. He said he would send one out, he said he would send a shipping notice to my sons email when it was shipped, etc. When I first wrote this review I gave IKEA a one star because after all the talk, my son didn't receive a notification or anything and I really didn't think IKEA was going to send the leg, but I was on my way back to OH and my daughter-in-law called and said the leg had come! Thanks, IKEA. You came through! I can fully recommend even distance travelers!",Trustpilot_USA

"Do not buy from ikea dubai very bad customer service and employee . Do not buy from ikea
Shame on you!!!

I have never encountered in my life such a bad and poor customer service and behavior.
I went to ilea exactly 7pm.
So my first trolley was full I left it aside as they asked me to do and took another trolley and filled it as well along with 3000 furniture purchase
So total is around 5000 aed and there was going to be another visit to finish my purchase.
So by 11:20 pm I finished my shopping and I went to collect my first trolley turn out they took it and empty everything in it.

Imagine shopping from 7 pm to 11 pm while being extremely sick ? I tor appart my bill and left as no one was helping me.
I asked several times for the manager and no one came
The employee was not helpful or co-opporating to help me, all he did was going to other employee to tell them what happend and also he said I told them it is someone trolley but they didn’t listen.
I went to customer service after being frustrated all she said was “sorry”
Where do I exchange the 4 hour shopping and wasting my time with ur sorry.
She didn’t even stop me to fix the problem.

IKEA you a dis-grace to your industry and very disappointing the kind of employee u hire.
I will make sure to leave my bad reviews all over for people to be cautious and I would recommend them to visit other stores in dubai atleast they have good employee who know what they are doing and excellent customer service .

The website says for ordering the online items: ""Dit product is alleen online te bestellen OF VIA EEN MEDEWERKER IN DE WINKEL"": now this last one you can forget. In the shop they said it is a different system, they could not order it.
And, when you finally decided to order it online, you go to your basket, the item is ""op voorraad"", and when you hit the Order button: ""Het spijt ons, de gekozen artikelen zijn nit op voorraad. Check the beschikbaarheid morgen nogmals""

"IKEA two sofas and a rather uncaring attitutde . We had two order numbers to buy a sofa from IKEA and had all kinds of problems. After we bought the 1st order on a ""click and collect"" basis, we went to the store to pick it up and found out that it had been cancelled by a staff member. We finally got the refund on November 28 after spending countless calls and time waiting on the IKEA customer service line. Since the store is far away from us we had to return home to order (we could not reorder at IKEA) it online. We arranged for delivery to our house. On the day of delivery, the driver did not have an important piece with him. For the inconvenience, we were given a $30 gift card (which we don't even want to use at this point). As we tried to assemble the sofa, we discovered that the pieces were completely wrong so the sofa had to be returned. The shipping charges were waived. While I was building the replacement sofa however, I was using the IKEA wrench that came with the sofa and due to a small sliver of metal that was protruding I badly cut my finger. It took me quite some time to staunch the bleeding. IKEA was quite concerned and when they called back to get the lot no. of the wrench, I had to lift the sofa (alone) from one side to the other until I finally found the number that they sought. You would think that they would have appreciated that but no. They offered (another) gift certificate which I refused saying that after injuring myself, helping them discover this production issue and having to move a heavy sofa alone, I would have expected more. Thereafter I was called by an IKEA manager saying that they did not credit any money for injury because there was ""no loss of money in a transaction"". I found this to be rather surprising. I was close to having to get stitches and after all of the time spent on the phone trying to call (they must have asked me to call back about 10 times with average wait times of 45 minutes), cutting myself and trying to help them by locating required information, I was astonished. I would have expected more. But alas, IKEA has changed.",Trustpilot_USA

"Blatant scam artists! Cannot believe such a big company can get away with this. . Bought the Hemnes 6 drawer. Product bowed and drawers did not shut after 1 or 2 weeks. The product has a inherent design flaw and if you actually read up on the product nearly 100% of people experience this. It has no supporting leg at the front in the middle so it naturally just dips under its own weight. Ikea had someone come inspect it to make sure it was a manufacturing fault and not our fault, upon walking into the room he laughed ""oh not another one of these, I don't even need to ask where the problem is"". Ikea should not be selling this, and despite having concrete feedback from their inspection, they are making it VERY hard to organise a refund. We have to disassemble this large, heavy unit with no instructions and zero damage so that it can be returned to them. Considering these things are designed to not come apart after they are built... talk about bad customer service.

This practice is as bad as quality of their products. So I'll post my experience with their product here for everyone to read.

I know IKEA makes cheap furniture, I do not expect much believe me. But I was horrified how degraded IKEA quality over the years. I have a bookcase that I have purchased from IKEA about 10 years ago and it's a solid piece of wood, it's heavy constructed, still holding up fine. I wanted to replace it with two of these bookcases thinking that I'll be getting similar build level. I was so wrong. I guess IKEA cut all possible corners in 10 years to make it as cheap as it can be to manufacture. It's so flimsy and unstable, the sides are not solid pieces but just a frame with think inserts. The bookcase is constructed in a such way that it can not be put flush against a wall if you have baseboard because the read ""legs"" do not have a cutout for it. Quality of woodwork is horrible - it's uneven, unrefined and plain bad. Two of my side boards are not even glued properly and sliding back and forth in slots. I'm not going to talk about the design because it's non-existent. Paint is as cheap as everything else and while it's called dark-brown it's in reality simply black probably for the purpose of hiding bad wood quality. I will repeat again, I was extremely disappointed when I have unpacked the bookcase, this whole thing just screams in your face - CHEAP, CHEAP, CHEAP. Now I'm not sure if it's worth wasting my time to try to put it together or I can just throw it away immediately. I wouldn't complain if it would cost you $50 but for $150 this is just a robbery in a daylight. I will never recommend to anyone to buy anything in IKEA from now on, IKEA quality went too downhill in the last years.",Trustpilot_USA

"We had the worst experience with the… . We had the worst experience with the third party delivery company (XPO) IKEA uses in NY City. Their staff were incompetent, rude and aggressive with my husband and our building manager / concierge. XPO made several mistakes in delivering our furniture and we spent multiple hours on the phone for days trying to rectify that. The XPO staff also refused to deliver large items to our apartment but instead dumped them in the lobby of the building. The building has a service elevator so delivery to a particular floor is not a problem.

My advice would be to avoid deliveries from IKEA in NY City. The time you would spend resolving problems with the delivery company would cost you a lot more than just buying your furniture elsewhere.",Trustpilot_USA

So basically I put in a huge order almost 2 weeks ago and they were missing an entire couch I ordered.

"NIGHTMARE PURCHASE WITH IKEA . Horrific, third party delivery company employed by IKEA. If you cant pick it up at the store and take it with you BEWARE! Let me just tell you that if you do not heed this advice and you trust them to deliver something to you in a manner that you will find pleasing and excellent....YOU ARE TAKING A HUGE RISK! I had to reschedule a delivery for some stand up mirrors (that I ordered online and spent over $500.00 + dollars for. I was challenged by uncaring, incapable and at worse, ignorant service personnel at every turn. To be fair, the employees of the third party deliver service that IKEA contracts with in the San Diego County area were the ones that I would corral into the ignorant and uncaring category. However, some of the staff at IKEA's 800 number fell into this category as well. It got to a point where they were mad at me for being frustrated. As if I didn't have a right after 3 failed delivery attempts (and broken promises by them) and me taking 2 days off from work to be there to receive my product and no delivery people showing up....and not even having the courtesy to call me and tell me that they weren't coming? The service failures are so egregious it nearly borders on conspiracy theory material.

To this day, I have still never received my shipment nor gotten a refund. I even responded to several of their automated follow up messages and gave them a 1 star.....I still never heard anything from whomever was supposed to be monitoring the customer review process! It defies logic. I have never wished ill upon any company other than the perhaps say, the IRS. However, I do sadly hope that IKEA goes the way of the dodo bird and becomes extinct. This is because I truly feel they don't care about me/us enough to step up and listen when their clients are asking for their help.

P.S. I noticed when looking for review sites for IKEA, that the independent review sites that IKEA does not control have VERY low scores from customers. However, IKEA's own client feedback site seems to contradict that with much higher aggregate reviews???? Um, who's review site do you trust? Pretty safe to say that the independent review sites like this one with an average customer review score of just over 2 is probably a lot closer to the truth. I hope this review has been helpful. Thank for taking the time to feel my pain. Trust me, I have much better things to do with my time :-( ARGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

"Ikea Germany . Ikea Germany: total disaster! Absolutely not recommend.

I have been an Ikea's customer since late 90's. In general I have been always satisfied with their products - design, quality vs price, etc.
I had never problems with Ikea in Poland and Denmark. Never.
In Germany things look different.

I had huge problem with delivery. Delivery was delayed - and it wasn't my fault. I took a day off, stayed home to be sure everything will go smoothly. Unfortunately it didn't.

Finally, after 12 days since I completed and paid for my order, I got my furniture. Everything at once. In a small apartment.

Top 3 problems with Ikea Germany that make my really angry:

1. It is NOT POSSIBLE to contact Ikea's tel. customer service.
I tried more than 20 times. Different days. Different hours.
The line was continuously busy. The line is unattended and it's even not possible to wait in a queue. Automated ""support"" inform you the line is busy, recommends you visit Ikea.de website and disconnects you! So good luck.

2. Customer service via email works extremely slowly. You have to wait minimum 24 hours for an answer. Minimum.

3. It's very difficult to find someone who can help you in English, but let's say that's my problem. On the other hand, Ikea is a global company and they hire a lot of people who speak English.
In Denmark it's not a problem.

I am truly disappointed by Ikea.
My attitude to the company has changed dramatically.
I just have a feeling that Ikea Germany doesn't care so much about its customers.

With Ikea everything is seems to be ok when you come to the store. Pick up your stuff, pay and leave.
If you expect additional service prepare for problems and ignorance.

That's all.",Trustpilot_USA
"Absolutely FUMING - Never, Ever, Ever Order from Ikea Online . Genuinely never had a worse retail experience in my life. This whole ordeal has been going on for about 3 weeks now. I made an online order of a mirror, a shoe rack, 4 glasses, a small ironing board and some reusable bags. Not one item was delivered in one piece or undamaged.

For some reason my order was split into two deliveries. In the first was the mirror, which arrived completely smashed to pieces and my nice cream net bags and ironing board were covered in black dirt. The mirror was rescheduled for another delivery, fine. My other delivery with the shoe rack and glasses took a total of 2 weeks, 4 non-attempts to deliver by my driver (despite my partner staying home from work to take these deliveries in, the driver couldn't be bothered to ring the doorbell or call us). The delivery was finally made after 2 phone calls and 2 online chats (one with an insanely rude and unhelpful staff member called Matt - unbelievable, this guy should be sacked), but two of the glasses were smashed into tiny pieces and the shoe rack was really badly damaged (very deep scratches on top and one of the corners completely worn off). I called to complain last week, and was told the replacement delivery would be made today. I needed to change the delivery date so tried to call up, I was told to call DPD which cost me £6, even though I was told the replacement items would be delivered by Ikea themselves. I was told to just await my text concerning delivery and then I could make amends. There was also a possibility of it being delivered in the morning which would suit me but I was sent no text or email or anything concerning my delivery. I got onto the website chat service, was put into contact with who I think is the same rude Matt from before, who tells me they are actually out of stock and they were to re-access the stock and contact me on the 13th, two days from now.

All of this wonderful delivery service cost me a whopping £39. I feel like I'm in the Twilight Zone with this entire experience. What on earth?? Please take my advice, and never order from Ikea online under any circumstance, it's not worth the stress or colossal amount of time you'll waste.

UPDATE: I asked for a refund and I've only been refunded for the items and not the £39 delivery charge. I'm absolutely furious, never experienced anything close to this terrible experience before.",Trustpilot_USA
"Don’t trust IKEA PAX Drawing program, it will cost you! . We designed our wardrobe (PAX) in their program. Everything seemed great until we got our delivery. Somehow An additional wardrobe was added to our order which we paid for as well. The wardrobe was nowhere to be found in the drawing we made. Further investigation showed that somehow an additional wardrobe was added outside the drawing area. Ikea agreed it was a technical bug that shouldn’t have happened but refused to help with picking up the additional wardrobe. It would cost me 800 to have them pick it up, which is equal to the price of the wardrobe. I am not able to return the product myself since the package is 220cm long and doesn’t fit in my car. IKEA’s customer service failed hard today. Acknowledging a problem but refusing the help out by offering a simple solution, to help their customer with a pick up.

so i decied to take it then I asked to HOW I can buy from showroom when it's a lost stock ?

they said I need to disassemble myself and bring it to the down to till and pay then apply delivery
and i said what ? i have no tools and how I can bring 5 seats sofa and disassemble myself TO delivery part.

so I told her I couldn't belive there is no other way
she said sorry you have to do your yourself

even I asked her borrow tools to do it because i don't have but she said I need to use my tools.

I noticed her I'm going to store customer service and will ask them
if it is true i will give up if not I will make a complaint.
and I went to store customer service centre in store then other your team said we can help you

however while i was in the queue to payment and waiting my turns about talkig with store customer service team IT's GONE somebody already take it.

and I went to check it's actually gone and I asked to other staff how other customer take it from show room.

they said they helped customer to disassemble and carry
and I ask to IKEA cutomer service they said sorry nothing we can do. even they contact me almost 2 weeks later.

Most online retailers charge you when they ship. So, they keep my money for 3-4 weeks from charge (order date) to refund. In addition to making it almost impossible for you to get customer service, to change an order, or to cancel an order.
If they hold thousands or hundreds of dollar from customer like this, that sounds like a financial fraud.",Trustpilot_USA

"IKEA is awful . IKEA is awful. The product is nicely priced but the delivery service and the pairing with Task Rabbit is a disaster. I have 4 mangled PAX units and a Besta in my bedroom not attached to walls ( and I have an infant) for the last 3 1/2 weeks. If you have a problem you get sent to a different phone number or online for everything and you never get a person. Last night, I went to the planning center in Manhattan to ask about my pick up which I was emailed by someone would be today. The manager was kind enough to make a few calls and told me that my pick up had been rescheduled until Monday. He was emailing or texting with someone else. I was told they would take the damaged units as is if they fit through the door. Today, at 4:30 I had an IKEA delivery person in front of my building for a pick up. I live in Manhattan you can’t just show up at buildings whenever you want. There are delivery hours and COIs. The pick up delivery/guy refused to take the units. Frustrated I then took a cab back across town to speak with the manager who had sworn to me that no one was coming today when I went yesterday. Also, that I would not have to disassemble the units. If they fit through the door they would be taken.
I will say, the delivery guy said that there had been a lot of complaints with IKEA recently. I do not doubt it. I think the people I encountered working there were very nice but the company is very big and there are HUGE management and communication issues.",Trustpilot_USA

"They take your money but don't see why… . They take your money but don't see why they should pay it back even if you're within your rights! Fraudulent behaviour! BEWARE!

We purchased a KALLAK desk online on 30/08/2019 at 20:47 through the store in Wednesbury-Birmingham and paid for delivery at the store because we were advised that it was not available for store purchase and collection.

We were unsure whether it would be right for our house and asked the store representative if we could cancel it after payment.

The store representative specified that if we were to notify in time before the order is processed then that's fine. I went and cancelled in store within 24 hours. Sounds simple!

However, the store couldn't get the refund done because it was an online order. How bizzare! That's the first time I've come across an online refund that couldt be carried out immediately without the order being processed because of the order being placed online in the store. Anyway, the store representative then raised a case (Case ID 32201051) and notified me that it will be refunded in 5 Working days. For reassurance he gave me a contact number 020 3645 0000 to ring and track the refund.

I rang IKEA explaining the situation and they made it clear that I would receive the refund in 5 working days. I've tracked my online credit card and there has been no refund, even my statement does not show it. Its been almost 1 Month!

I keep ringing but can't get through. This is wasting my time and money.

I would advise not purchasing from IKEA unless you are 100% sure with your purchase. Their service is terrible, even in store, the customer service is really bad, slow and poor.

You may as well pay a bit more and go to a good furniture retailer without the hassle.

"IKEA Delivery: As much use as an ejector seat in a helicopter! . Ordered a sofa bed
It arrived on time, then the delivery guy decided to stand one box upright and walked off. Unsurprisingly the box toppled over as the balance was WAY off!
The box landed on metal railings between the two properties and punctured the box, packaging and product.

After inspecting the damage it was immediately obvious the product was punctured from falling onto the railings - I refused delivery of that part of the product and requested a replacement.

I've then had calls to the IKEA customer services center and arranged for delivery on the only day it was possible for me to be in to receive it. (Job commitments mean there was no way I'd be present during normal hours)

Delivery date and time arranged and I even made special arrangements to leave early to ensure I'd be back well ahead of the delivery window.

I then get a text to tell me that the delivery has been moved TO THE FOLLOWING DAY!

I've now wasted a lot of time having to ring up and speak to customer services to explain the situation, wasted my phone credit, wasted my time, put myself in the spot light for arranging to leave early at work all because the delivery agent couldn't do his job correctly. I can't even fix this myself as the item isn't held in store (Directly delivered from the warehouse only)

The online system is a joke. The chat says I am number 1 in line with 0 minutes wait, then makes me sit there for 15 minutes with no updates.

While waiting for the agent, I called the local store. After punching in endless options, they announced ""call volume is unusually high"" and hung up! Not even an option to leave my name and number for someone to call me back.

By now I received the confirmation of my order but the time was wrong. I tried calling the customer service number on the order form twice only to have them hang up on me both times. I tried fixing it through chat but it said ""we are unavailable to chat with you at this time. Please try again during chat hours."" (I WAS chatting during normal business hours). I did finally re-schedule via email only to receive a phone call on the day that the technician was waiting for me at the house at the wrong time.

I informed her I was waiting for a while and was there before them and requested her to help me first as I was searching for her throughout the entire store, I even asked her coworkers where she was. The couple even knew I was there first and we’re more than happy for her to serve me first. So she did, although she was EXTREMELY rude and was not even helping me, instead she was rushing to get back to the couple because apparently they had an appointment. So I told her to go help them and to please return to assist me afterwards. She asked if they had an appointment and they did not. Instead, they had the exact same question as I did about the exact same lights. I was waiting at the same area as the couple and the woman and over heard her being the nicest person I have ever seen. Then when she was done with them, she turned to me and started yelling at me and telling me I was rude for requesting to be served first even though I was there first and the couple did NOT have an appointment with her. I was so baffled that she treated me the way she did all due to my hijab. She told me off and told me to wait where I was and sent me Isiah D. who was MORE than helpful and continued apologizing for the actions of this woman. I just do not understand why I was treated with such disrespect from this woman, and it was not isiahs job to apologize for her actions and hurtful words. Because of isiah’s help I was able to buy three thousand dollars worth of housing equipment. Although isiah was able to make my experience better, it was still extremely upsetting and racist the way I was treated and I will not be returning to IKEA. It’s upsetting to see that racism is still a huge issue in our world, especially in an area where you are a customer service representative and should be treating people with the upmost respect.",Trustpilot_USA

Sadly, they opted to use a courier for delivery and didn't pass on my phone number, so a week later they still hadn't delivered and I called IKEA. They didn't want to take responsibility, and basically left it for me to sort out. I work. I'm not at home between 9am and 5pm. That's why my original delivery was on a Sunday. Several other calls to IKEA and an escalation to a supervisor who is yet to follow up, I finally received the replacement part. And you know what? All 4 corners are damaged!

My reply was to ask them to ensure that the delivery would be made early the next morning, like any other company would do when they failed to fulfill a simple service. The best they could offer was redelivery in 3 days. Unacceptable, but what could I do, they were holding my furniture hostage at that point. Third confirmed delivery date, with 4 hour window. Again, no-call no show. This time we DROVE out to the local Ikea and tried to get an explanation, which they had none since it was ""in XPO's hands"". Later that night I got a robocall from XPO explaining that ""the truck broke down"". Was given a FOURTH confirmed delivery date with a 4 hour window. Again, a no-call no-show. Four wasted days waiting for a delivery that never arrived, with poor customer service from both Ikea and XPO to boot. We canceled the order with Ikea (we will miss shopping your store, but this online experience was just oh-so frustrating), placed an order with Wayfair for a nearly identical item that was delivered in two days via Fedex. 8 days later, still waiting for my refund from Ikea, I guess I'll dip my toes into the water and call customer service, AGAIN.",Trustpilot_USA

"Ikea assemble team . This rating is not for our experience in IKEA Dublin but for the attitude and end product we got from the assemble team (One member in particular) who came to our home and put together our wardrobe.

We spent almost 2 thousand euro (400 euro approx. on labour) on a wardrobe which was tailored in store to fit our dimension requirements. All panels arrived by Ikea's courier on the Friday and the 2 man assemble team arrived on the Monday.

When they arrived, the senior assembler was angry that the panels weren't in the bedroom with all of the wrapping removed. When trying to explain that there was only a pregnant woman present at home when the courier delivered the panels and that there was no way she could've brought them upstairs, he didn't seem bothered and gave my partner attitude because 'she should've had this done before they arrived'. He had a poor attitude throughout the duration they were here. They came without a blueprint of any description of what we ordered. Expecting us to provide photos of what we ordered. This, in my opinion should be prepared by IKEA and provided to the assemble team as it was built using a virtual program in store. As there was no blueprint, they ended up building a wardrobe that was not in the arrangement which we agreed on in store.

"No Delivery and No on the Spot Refund? . Until this week, was a great believer in Ikea, being a regular customer in Australia and Europe over years. However a refusal of an immediate refund of around $140 for an online order that was not delivered by Toll as promised, has left me gobsmacked.
I have cctv footage of the truck arriving and 2 different drivers on 2 different days putting a missed delivery card under my door without any attempt at ringing doorbell. Ikea are stating the parcel shows as ""delivered"" by Toll. I also rang Toll for the second time today and finally was put through to someone in Australia so I could raise a complaint and she said the parcel is sitting at Tullamarine. I am very unhappy as my contract is with Ikea and not with Toll. I said I had over 3 days attempted to manage this delivery on line and on phone with Toll and I was done. Asked Ikea to intervene and was told I had to go back to Toll. I said I would no longer do that as I had no confidence in them and I would not waste another day hoping for someone to ring my doorbell. So then I demanded a refund. Seems I have to raise a dispute because Ikea will not guarantee a refund or when I will get it. Lose a loyal customer over $140....and I have all the video evidence.So far spent more than 1 hour on phone with toll, 3 times on line managing delivery all with conflicting information, 2 calls to Ikea wasting at least another 2 hours.

We even spoke to a manager who had the guts to suggest we put it in a car and drive it over to them even after I told him we didn't have a car and that we placed the order online and paid for delivery.

So, at that stage we decided to call the bank and request that the payment made by credit card be reversed since Ikea was holding our money and refused to give us a refund. The bank initiated the reverse process and it was then that Ikea decided to come and collect their bed. They promised a $75 dollar voucher which we still haven't seen. The whole ordeal took 3 weeks to settle.

We decided to give Ikea a second chance given their gesture of goodwill ($75 voucher) and ordered items worth over $500 online again. I paid for express delivery (next day). I got confirmation once the payment went through on IKEA.com that the items would be delivered today, 04 August between 9am and 1pm. I get two missed calls from Ikea at around 9.49am. I tried to call the number and couldn't get through to anyone so I called the 800 number. The guy could not find the order number I gave him, which I had received from Ikea.com (and I never got an email confirmation). Then he used my phone number and other verifications to find the order. It had a completely different number. He thought I had got it wrong but I told him I had made a screenshot of the confirmation and read it to him twice. Then he tells me that there must have been a mistake because the order was made in-store. I was shocked. I never went to the store to make the order. He could not explain what happened. They have a glitch in their system and no one has the bleakest idea they did? It turns out my delivery was scheduled between 5pm and 9pm, therefore I had lost my morning, and now I was going to lose the entire afternoon/evening. So, I spent my entire Montreal Summer Sunday waiting for Ikea. Past 9pm, nothing! I call again and again. Wait time of course 30-50mins on average, only to be told that nobody knows why my order has not arrived so some delivery dept. person would call me on Monday. I guess I will have to reverse the payment again and they should do what they wish with their stuff!

I have to say that this order was planned with Ikea team for hours, all the measurement were known to them when we made the order.

"Missing items .. no bed for baby . 4 day wait . So, I’ve got to say IKEA customer service is the worst I’ve ever encountered. Got the items delivered but after building the first item, the second (a wardrobe) had parts missing. Rang IKEA to ask them to arrange for delivery of the missing parts and got told I’d have to wait until Saturday! Now, because I needed to build the wardrobe before the bed (due to space in the room), this meant my 19 month old would have no bed until Saturday, and IKEA were quite happy with this. Not good enough, after going round in circles for over 30 mins I said I would drive to IKEA, about 100 mile round trip! IKEA could not guarantee to cover my fuel and refused to refund the delivery, they offered only a £10 voucher for me to spend in store! I refused this as got told I couldn’t have both voucher and fuel (if they agreed to cover this in-store). After going round in circles on the phone the call operator refused to pass the issue up the chain and to give me any details of where to complain to and ask for any type of refund. When in-store they agreed to cover fuel cost (not sure it covered the fuel but they have a basic rate per mile that is non-negotiable). Gets even better, as when leaving IKEA, I saw loads of vans and also hire vans that they could have used to deliver my goods that they didn’t pack. I have just finished building the items at 23.25 so at least my little girl has somewhere to sleep, not that IKEA could care! Going to post on all sites I know but hold little hope of getting any kind of apology or refund as they seem to have unlinked themselves from IKEA on trust pilot! They obviously enjoy taking your money but when things go wrong and they are at fault they cannot accept it and actually make it more stressful. Like I said, the worst customer care I’ve ever had.

"Order delayed for 14 days, no real solution given ... . I've been shopping with IKEA for a while but had a bad experience when an order went wrong ...

On July 2nd I made my order online for several items. They were scheduled for delivery on July 10th. I received an email back with a summary of my order, and a message saying i would receive a confirmation of the order within 48 hours.

After three days I didn’t receive any confirmation and so I sent a Facebook message (July 5th) asking about my order. I got a response quickly, and the representative told me someone would look into it to see if the order / payment went through or not, and that they would be happy to book or rebook for me. I was also told that I would get an email within a few days if they were able to book/rebook. So it sounded fine ...

But I didn’t receive any emails. I checked in again when I got no response, and the representative told me to check in again in two days.

Then, the second time I checked in I was told the department was away and that I would have to wait longer ...

Then FINALLY, 11 days after asking, on 14 July I was told that the payment didn’t go through and I would need to rebook the whole thing. (And of course, you often have to wait a few days to a week for a delivery to be scheduled and to arrive.) My delivery was supposed to arrive more than a week ago, now it will probably be another week or two ...

Here's what I'm not happy about. If I’d known from the beginning my didn’t go through, I would have simply rebooked and not had to experience such a delay. It was very confusing I got an automated email that summarized my order but that the order didn't go through. Also strange that the department was ""away"" and nobody knew the status of the order until 11 days after I asked about it.

And of course annoying that I had to check in a few times only to get nowhere ...

For all of that I thought it was reasonable to ask for some sort of discount on my rebooking.

They said it was not possible but that they would offer me two free lunches to visit their store ... I don't really see that as a good solution though since I was never planning to go to the store in person and would need to spend money to drive or take transportation there. I told the rep that, and the rep said ""I cannot offer you anything of more value.""

The customer service team was trying to be helpful I think, but unfortunately it seems they can't offer anything of real value to upset customers or provide much assistance when problems come up. The good thing is that the customer service reps were pretty quick to respond.

So I don't blame the people I spoke to -- but the system, policies, and how it's set up which doesn't make much sense to me.",Trustpilot_USA

I tried phoning IKEA at 888-888-4532 multiple times to report the missing part. Every time the recorded message said the phone lines were busy and hung up. I then submitted the ""Missing/Damaged Merchandize"" form online, reporting the missing part. Instead, I was informed that a replacement for the entire sleeper sofa would be shipped and that I would have to disassemble the first sleeper sofa for return to IKEA.

For damaged items, the recording said they were not taking any calls at this time. So.... I called back to speak with someone in sales, *since I knew they would answer). They rerouted me to the correct dept., and I waited close to a half hour for someone to pick up, but no one ever did.
So....went on line and submitted a complaint about my broken item. Normally, when you deal with a decent company, they send you a courtesy letter that someone is checking into the issue and will be in touch within a certain amount of time. I've heard nothing from IKEA. Actually, they have lost a customer due to their horrible customer service. I don't even care about the broken pedestal anymore.

"This is my worst eCommerce experience . This is my worst eCommerce experience, bar none. If you want to buy something from Ikea, drive to the store even if it's 4 hours away, it will be less work than trying to convince someone to deliver it to you.

I do like Ikea's designs but fulfillment is not their bag, do yourself a favor and go get it yourself.

Their customer service is nonexistent. You feel like you've slipped somewhere between a CIA behavior control experiment and the 8th circle of hell.

I've never had the pleasure being on hold for 2 hours. Not only that, it was to the wrong department and when they're transferred me the system dropped the call. Truly a singular experience!

The way the system is supposed to work:
1. you place an order
2. you get a phone call with a delivery window (robot, use a cell phone, don't use your business line)
3. After you confirm they'll deliver.

What actually happens:
1. you place an order
2. you never get a phone call
3. they send an email stating that they missed the delivery and they might cancel the order / charge you for re-delivery and you need to call them
4. you call them, wait on hold for 2 hours. When you finally get a person they say you've reached the wrong department and they need to transfer you. When they transfer you the system tells you the call volume is too high and hangs up.
5. repeat
6. you call at 6AM to reach them at opening time on the east coast and reach a person. They reschedule the delivery and tell you you should get a phone call from the delivery company the day before.
7. You don't get a phone call.
8. You call the delivery company (T Force) and they tell you they have no record of your order. You ask them to talk to Ikea, and after being pushier than you should have to be they finally find your order with Ikea. (quick tip: T Force can skip the Ikea phone call queue) They tell you that Ikea has rescheduled your delivery and it will arrive Monday.
10. You get another email promising a Monday delivery
11. You don't get a confirmation call (again)
12. You call T-Force back and again they can't find your order. (again) They talk to Ikea again. Hang up on you at least once. Call back. And you're told they're positive your order is cancelled and the only way to get a delivery is to place the order again.

In all I have 6 delivery dates that Ikea promised. Spent more time on hold than the round trip would have been to Ikea's store. My wife I and I both called T Force and Ikea countless times. Never once did we get a confirmation phone call. (we had them check the phone number, in case, and it was fine) So at this point I'm going to certify myself insane if I try this again.

So I looked online and saw that sensible people where calling their credit card company to have the charges reversed. After only a few minutes on the phone, that was done.

Good riddance to bad rubbish.

I have the sneaking suspicion that T Force shares a large part of this responsibility. It was their system that never called me. I live in Santa Maria, California which may be way outside their normal delivery radius. I wouldn't be surprised that they simply couldn't make money making my delivery and their system simply kicked me out logistically as irrelevant. Then Ikea points figures at T Force and T Force points fingers at Ikea and they both hope you just go away.",Trustpilot_USA

I called FedEx and they were very concerned about a missed delivery. They found the package the next day and delivered it. Ikea could care less.

"Oh no! Ikea . I ordered Ikea's play kitchen for my niece on the 20th May for delivery 22nd - to arrive in time for her birthday on the 25th. Instead of being given my one hour delivery slot on the 22nd I was sent a text saying my parcel had been delayed due to an unexpected issue, then the day after another text with the same message but preceeded by an 'oh no!', which was a bit bizarre. (Glad they find it so ironic) Rang DPD the delivery firm and got litttle information - call handler reading from a script promised delivery by ten that evening - but, it's now the 25th and still no delivery and no update. (Some of the calls to DPD are charged at a premium rate, so you can potentially pay six pounds to NOT discover why your order hasn't arrived) Ikea were polite and tried to be helpful but have no access to DPD's system and can't advise but can only apologise. So this is an ongoing review as to how bad DPD and therefore Ikea can actually manage to be - a week late with their delivery? Two maybe? Who knows - definitely not me - meanwhile i'm the awful aunt without a birthday present.

It turns out that DPD and Ikea CAN better their awful record to date. My play kitchen wasn't delayed it was lost in DPD's system and they should have known at the beginning because if their records show a parcel hasn't been scanned it should throw up a 'red flag'. But in this case no red flag. (Tellingly, when ringing DPD, customers are forced to listen to a recording of the 'director of customer experience' urging them to be nice even if they're annoyed or want to let off steam.) So I return to to Ikea who issue gushing apologies and re-order the play kitchen to arrive on the 31st May. And, I'm gobsmacked to find, it's another no show on this date. DPD say they have no record of my re-order so back to Ikea who issue more gushing apologies because they've pushed my delivery date back to June 2nd and, despite having my mobile number and email, didn't bother to tell me. The customer service adviser agrees with every word I say, for example, your customer service is awful, your customer service is a farce and quite possibly a pantomime too, treating customers like this is inexcusable etc etc. (She doesn't seem to mind a bit of annoyance and letting off steam. perhaps desensitized after receiving so many complaints). So I'm still waiting to discover, twelve days past my original delivery date, will the play kitchen arrive!!

June 2nd - still no delivery. Ikea now tell me that my re-order has been blocked due to the way the re-order was re-ordered! Assurances that everything will be successfully unblocked, authorised and ready to go some time in the future. Yawn, yawn. Can't even be bothered getting annoyed or letting off steam anymore. If you want anything from Ikea, GO TO THE STORE TO GET IT.

My order finally arrived two weeks late. Woo hoo Ikea. Now all I have to do is assemble it!

We wanted everything delivered. We agreed to take one sofa home and they said they will help us with the order.

Read very carefully Task Rabbit’s terms and conditions for using YOUR personal information — if you read that you might not want to do any business with them! I bought a bed with drawers on Easter weekend and was told I could book assembly quickly via a link online (through Task Rabbit). Tried to book assembly only to get stuck on Task Rabbit platform because they ask for “postal code” but don’t mean where you want the assembly done but mean your credit card billing address postal code. So I entered the postal code for where I wanted the goods that I had delivered assembled (and my credit card information including code on back) just to have the link not work (but was able to find out through my credit c co. that Task Rabbit apparently did a check of my credit c billing address! So their online platform tells you nothing about where your credit card info went and you just get a link that doesn’t work to get you to the next step of connecting with an installer — but someone has that info to be calling my credit c company. Task Rabbit customer service useless - you get different replies from different people (just like at IKEA). you get automatic reponsr saying your email may be answered in “days”. To top it all off a Google search of Task R reveals they were the subject of a data breach! So this company now has my credit card information and was unable to use it for he purposes intended (assembly) but has it while the customer wonders why the screen is not advancing to the next step. IKEA does not care about a customer’s post purchase experience — instead trying to blame it on a totally independent company TAsk Rabbit (which is really IKEA). Their “customer service” agents are rude and try a lot of doubletalk!

No one in the household could make the very broad 4-hour excepted time and asked a customer service agent to contact the driver to let he/she know to leave it at the front desk of our apartment buildings (which they already consented too.) The customer service agent called and called but the driver didn’t answer, so she left a voicemail and assured me this wouldn’t be an issue. Later in the day, I receive a voicemail (no call, just voicemail) that I missed my allotted (4-hour long) appointment time and that they would need to reschedule and I would need to re-pay the delivering fee. They later informed me that drivers can only deliver to the address registered, so why didn’t the customer service agent I spent over a half hour on the phone with that morning inform me of that policy? They also only deliver to my area on Thursday’s, which meant we would have to wait another week for our furniture. End of story, I received a refund and will just get my furniture elsewhere. Would not recommend IKEA or their customer service.",Trustpilot_USA
Ikea’s not fit for purpose kitchens . Had one of Ikea kitchens fitted 3 years ago. The veneer has started coming off 3 doors. Remarkably Ikea say it’s not their fault. So much for customer service.

"We purchased a kitchen and a dishwasher… . We purchased a kitchen and a dishwasher from IKEA. The dishwasher broke 4 months ago and is still under a warranty. To get it repaired one needs to go through IKEA and than through their subcontractors. Subcontractor cannot be contacted once they leave your home. They came 3 times now to fix and failed every time. Finally it was replaced and broke again after 5 days. Customer experience of dealing with IKEA and their subcontractors has been terrible. We still don’t have the working dishwasher and all the kitchen elements where the machine was fitted are not as they used to be (ie doors cannot be closed , one kitchen door is broken as a result of removal and installation of a new appliance). All in all , terrible customer experience which is really disappointing as we spent so much money with IKEA over so many years. we asked for a store credit (no amount specified) as a matter of showing respect to us as loyal customers who suffered tremendous inconvenience as a result of this especially as we have a newborn so without working kitchen it has bee really challenging. IKEA did Bit want to hear about that. Therefore we need to raise awareness about poor products and poor customer service and overall experience with IKEA. Good news is there is a lot more choice on the market at affordable prices so we have a lot more options than IKEA. We advise against IKEA kitchens.",Trustpilot_USA
"Absolutely useless . Absolutely useless. I applied for an Ikea credit card on the evening, and may I say, late evening of Thursday 3 - 7 - 19. I was excited and I already had in mind what I wanted to buy and had been looking it up on their website.

The next day, I was then told some 18 hours later that I was supposed to of used my card that I very evening to have gotten my $25 off my first purchase, 'even though I had no physical card in my hand.'

So within those few hours before midnight on that Thursday evening I should have used this card to have gotten $25 off my first purchase.

One of the most ridiculous things I've ever heard of in my whole life, and so poorly explained on the credit card application.

When I called the following day some 18 hours later I was told by 2 Ikea employees, (Ben being the second,) that I could never get this $25 again to use.

I cancelled the credit card instantly via Ben. I've already posted a blog about my experience on Facebook about this and I will be filing complaints with the Better Business Bureau, anywhere that has reviews on Ikea and also consumer affairs. People need to understand how ridiculous Ikea is and the bank that supports them.

UPDATE:

As time went on a complaint was filed with the Washington DC branch of the Better Business Bureau. Richard S in the corporate office at IKEA promised to send an e-card with $25 on it to an email address that I've used for almost 22 years and I check daily.

Never once did these number ever appear in my spam folder or my inbox. Then my other email address was given to him which I've had for 14 years and check mane times daily. Once again no $25 numbers ever appeared.

Finally Christine called from Ikea's Corporate office and left a message on my voicemail after I had talked to this particular lady the day before. At the time of this writing she said in a voice mail which was 17 days ago now, that a physical card would be mailed to me and would arrive in 7 to 10 days. Of course, no card has ever arrived

I've recently filed a complaint with the attorney General of Washington DC and Mrs Carter there has forwarded my complaint to the appropriate attorney General of the state that the Ikea is in.

I've come across a few other companies that are this awful with their constant lies about sending things to the customer. Let's be honest here, if Ikea were true to their word they would have spent a few extra cents and had this so called physical card sent to me with a tracking number. Even more simple, they would have called me on the phone and just given me the numbers.

I'm NOT surprised in the slightest that this company has a got a 1star review.",Trustpilot_USA

"I have had an appalling . I have had an appalling, unacceptable service with Ikea. I purchased some kitchen units on 17th April 2019 (Order ID 1027803844) and they were delivered on Good Friday however there was one item missing - a galvanised suspension rail to hang the kitchen units on the wheel which is a vital component.

After eventually finding the telephone number for Customer Services I got through to a lady called Cheryl and I was asked if I minded holding while she contacted the driver. On coming back to me I was told the driver had a look on his truck but could not find anything but would have a more thorough look at their next delivery and if they found it drop it around to me. In the meantime she said she would place an order for it and get it out to me asap, however, because of the Easter weekend could not get it delivered to me until Tuesday morning, this mucked up my planned DIY weekend.

On 22nd April (Easter Monday) I just had a gut feeling that something was going to go wrong with my delivery today as this is not the first time I have had a bad experience with IKEA, and sure enough I was right. I was told by a lady called Ketsya there had been a system error and the order had been blocked, and that they now would not be able to get this to me until Wednesday morning. I demanded to speak to a Supervisor and after 15-20 minutes arguing I was eventually put through to the floor supervisor Kelly who I proceeded to complain to. All she could do was offer me apologies and say that she would send ne a £20.00 gift voucher, which I believe is rubbing salt into the wounds as it just giving me a voucher to plough funds back into their company. I was assured by her and her colleague that I would definitely receive my missing item on Wednesday 24th April between 7:00am-1:00pm.I was sent an acknowledgement email confirming this and given a new Order ID - 1027110192. I have taken more time off work to receive the delivery.

My tale of woe does not end there - At 7:58 this evening (23rd April 2019) I got an email with the new invoice and saying that the delivery date is 25th April (Thursday) - As you can imagine I have had no other notice to say the date has changed and was extremely angry.

Again I got on to Customer Services and spoke to an advisor who said there was nothing they could do. I demanded to speak to a Manager and eventually after much reluctance was put through to a Mr Paul Taylor - Again I proceeded to complain, and he apologised but said he could not do anything or get the item to me tomorrow, I again said this was unacceptable and although it may seem petty that it was for a strip of metal that hangs the kitchen units, firstly it was an essential item and secondly I keep getting promised that I am going to receive it and it never happens. He said he was just going to see if there was anything he could do and put me on hold.

On coming back to me, he then proceeded to say that the only way I could get it earlier is if I went to Croydon store and picked it up - I explained that this was not good enough and that as a Manager he should be doing everything he can to get the item to me tomorrow even if it means sending the strip in an estate cab or on a van from the store. The Croydon store is a 30 minute drive from Bromley South.

I have now told him that I either want him or someone on his behalf to get in touch with Croydon and arrange for a delivery of my missing item by tomorrow and if this cannot be done I want to know why but I expect a call back from both his department and Croydon Store and if I do not receive this call by 11:00am tomorrow will not only be taking it up with the British Head Office but will be writing to the CEO in Sweden Mr Jesper Brodin . I wonder what his department would have to say about how the UK Customers are treated.

"IKEA ""missing assembly"" unfair charge . I will omit the details that it was difficult enough to negotiate with the IKEA service. Was everything described by other users - not possible to reach by phone, ignoring emails, cutting calls, etc. Finally, the kitchen assembly was scheduled for me on March 15th. Despite the fact that on the 15th I needed to be in the office, I asked for a leave to wait for the kitchen assambling. The time in the letter was indicated from 7 am to 9 pm, so I woke up at 7 am and began to wait. I was sitting literally next to the door, checked the doorbell in advance. The fact that I was at home can be checked with CCTV cameras. Unfortunately, after waiting for a whole day, noone came. In the evening, I went downstairs to check my mailbox I was very surprised to see the letter that they were coming, but they did not find me at home! This is an absolute lie. The saddest thing is that IKEA invoiced me for 75% of the assembly (371 euros without VAT), which I have to pay before April 15th. This is a cheating and fraud. Obviously, this is an established IKEA service scheme, to receive money without providing services: the situation repeated afterwards,with the next assambling service. On the day of delivery I got a call from the contact center by phone and and they said that the assembly workers could not reach me. I said a second, I will now go down and open the door. And a minute later a miracle happened - the workers finally managed to press the doorbell! And, finally, everything worked, I opened them and I did not have to go down. It is very strange, why they could not press the doorbell before someone called me from the contact center? I want to clarify that the house where I live is absolutely new, everything is in excellent condition and perfectly works. And on the dorbell downstairs my surname is written, as well as on the doorbell on my floor. Going to protect my rights - want to withstand this conscienceless scheme.",Trustpilot_USA

"My order has still not been delivered… . My order has still not been delivered properly. The original order date was March 15 to be sent to my parents address. My dad was there to sign for the order on March 21, but the delivery driver dropped off someone else’s order and not mine. I contacted IKEA and the customer service rep told me they would have someone pick it up and drop off the right order. She asked if I wanted to change the address for delivery and I said yes, change it to my apartment. So I wait a few days and receive a call it’s going to be delivered March 25. Then on March 25, I get a text from the delivery driver with a picture of the furniture dropped off at the original address, not the one I had changed it to. I went over to my parents address to pick it up, and only 3 of the 4 boxes were there. When I spoke to the delivery driver, they said they were only given 3 boxes from Ikea in round rock. But clearly on each box it says 2 of 4, 3 of 4, and 4 of 4. I didn’t get box 1 of 4. The delivery driver said he would still come to my apartment to pick up the ORIGINAL wrong persons furniture from the very first drop off, which he did. I called IKEA to tell them I am missing box 1 of 4, plus explained all of the problems I have had with this delivery, and the lady said they would be shipping me an entirely new dresser with all 4 parts. I told her I only needed box 1 of 4 but she insisted they resend everything, and the delivery driver would pick up the other 3 boxes when they drop the 4 boxes off. She gave me the delivery fee back, but when I asked for a manager or supervisor to explain this and get some sort of discount or anything really for all of the trouble, she said the manager would only give the delivery fee back. So I said okay and verified with her the dresser would be coming to my APARTMENT address. She said yes and they would call me when it’s being delivered. Now it is April 1 and I am still waiting for the dresser and have not received one call saying it will be delivered soon. This has been such a terrible experience. I won’t be buying from IKEA again and highly recommend not using their delivery services simply based on my own experience. When I spoke to customer service the second time, the lady was nice but made it seem like errors are quite common. If I don’t get the dresser by this Friday I will be asking for a refund and will take it as a lesson to simply never order from there again.

Found a chest of drawers I liked and which had the required dimensions and ordered it (only available online, though there's no way I'd have gone into a store to pick it up - too many members of the public desperate to leave negative reviews to contend with).

It came exactly on time, with lots of text messages to say when.

Assembly was a doddle. Discovered ONE screw missing at the end (should have been 24, but there were 23). Contacted IKEA via webchat, and they arranged to send out a spare immediately (7 day delivery time).

"IKEA MANAGEMENT at the Vegas Store… . IKEA MANAGEMENT at the Vegas Store and/or district is POOR.
Saturday 2/2/2019 I visited from 1PM to 2PM to buy a new wall lamp, desk chair, some 99 cent chocolate bars and a tiny plant for a friend's apartment.

I left IKEA Vegas with NONE of those things:

1. Not 1 of the NYMANE wall lamps in stock or even on display.
2. RENBERGET office chairs on display everywhere but ZERO in stock.
3. Over a dozen checkout registers but ONLY 3 OPEN with VERY LONG LINES OF UNHAPPY CUSTOMERS WAITING TO CHECK OUT.
4. Even the separate food department had a long line with only 1 cashier.

"I'm always shocked at the terrible customer service finding every reason to take your money and not return it . I'm always shocked at the terrible level of quality and durability of Ikea products. Every single one of their fabric products I've ever purchased, carpets, rugs, towels, Sheetz basically anyting made of any synthetic material is chock-full of chemicals. I've spent thousands and thousands of dollars at Ikea, their return policy is horrendous. They seem almost intentionally drastically understaffed, there's always a huge wait, they even have a number system if that tells you anything about how long the wait is. I've only tried to return a single item in my entire consumer live at Ikea, a $299 carpet that had a tiny hardened spot probably one centimeter big that they claimed was a paint stain, the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard, it was the exact same color as the carpet fabric was probably there from the time that I purchased it.

IKEA Bucharest fails on paying back the money they owe their customers . Good evening. I am struggling to get my money back in my account since 1st November 2018. I have ordered some products from IKEA Bucharest for my mother in Romania. I have paid using a credit card and as I didn't receive the payment confirmation I have paid with my debit card too. I wasn't aware that I have paid twice. I have acknowledged the double payment after few days after checking my account. I had to cancel the order as one item wasn't in store. Only one payment was returned in my account and I struggle since then with the Romanian Customer Service. I have claimed the reimbursement of the second payment . The last conversation and email I had with them was received on the 28th of December when I was informed that the payment will be done within 14 days. I know that the 14 days of waiting are not over yet but I am not sure that they will pay me the money back as I was already told the the money were send in my account few time since I have submitted the complaint. I fell like Don Quijote fighting the wind mills. Can IKEA Bucharest answer the question: When my money will be in my account?,Trustpilot_USA
"Put off IKEA forever. . Put off IKEA forever.
Purchased an £850 Pax wardrobe with sliding doors. We had no problem putting the unit together, but the trying to hang the doors was a nightmare. There were some grommets that kept falling off, we had to take the doors off and remove the shoe racks to put them back on. They wouldn't stay on, the door was screeching and one of the doors got scratched. We called IKEA, they sent ecomaster out. They guy came and said it was a manufacturing fault, he didn't even attempt to put the grommets back or stop the door from screeching, he said that he would recommend a replacement door and IKEA would be in touch. Two weeks later I contacted IKEA only to find out that ecomaster logged it as a customer fault, he said that we didn't put it together properly and he noted that both doors were on the same track. (that's not even possible, they are sliding doors, the rail isn't long enough to have both doors on the same track) complete lie! So after much fuss IKEA agreed to send ecomaster out again, this guy asked us for some felt strips, which were not in the box, he said this is why the door got scratched. Again he's going to refer this back to IKEA, and again I wait to hear from IKEA and ended up calling them. They again told me that the case was closed, ecomaster logged it as a customer fault, completely opposite to what he told us. Fortunately this time we recorded the whole visit. I'll be contacting trading standards. I will never shop at IKEA again, in fact I purchased a number of things for this room, and I returned all of it.

I contacted customer care who wanted us to rebuild them for inspection at my house. I refused & said they were more than welcome to build them if they wanted to look at them. They refused & after much back and forth, it was agreed that if I returned them to my nearest store, over an hour away, they would be refunded or replaced.
Drove 50 odd miles to Warrington, only to be told that they weren't going to do as promised, but instead wanted to rebuild the beds first. We had to leave them there & they would let us know the next step. This was Monday. I finally got a call back THURSDAY (after leaving at least 10 messages) telling me the beds aren't faulty. The ray of sunshine on the phone obviously watched Liitle Britain ""computer says no"" sketches to pick up tips on how to annoy customers. She refused point blank to give me the name of the head of customer service, the store manager & was basically as rude as she could get away with. 
I got straight off the phone, Googled the CEO of IKEA to get an email address. Within 5 minutes, an email was winging its way to Javier Quinones. Less than 12 hours later I had a response & after a couple of emails exchanged over the course of the day, a refund was offered & accepted.

My family and I waited for three hours. Beyond ridiculous. After an hour and a half, I finally couldn't take it anymore so I went up to the desk and asked what is the hold-up because our number was in the ""red zone"" for all this time. The rep. told me that our merchandise requires a forklift so that's why it's taking so long and to give them another 15 minutes. 15 minutes turned into 45 and still nothing.

"IKEA: Southampton . What! IKEA's average rating is a one. That's strange.

IKEA is one of the best constructed stores on the plant. The neatness they have to withstand for their furniture shop to keep running is incredible. If IKEA would not have any order then the shop would never exist.

Firstly, their quality is sublime..... cannot really put it into words. Anything you buy from IKEA will never break. Desks, chairs, pillow cases whatever..... they are all fantastic.

Secondly, their prices which in my opinion are overpriced. But then again IKEA make up for that with the quality and extraordinary quality. £600 for a 2 seat chair is not ideal to be honest and you could probably get a sofa at a 'sofa specialist' for half the price. Saying that though IKEA quality is superb.

Thirdly, their co-ordination is excellent and once you have gone to the store four or five times you will fully understand it. Little tip for everyone who goes to IKEA in Southampton: park on the top floor as the entrance is on the top floor. So the lower you park, the more time you have to waste on a escalator. Showrooms and the look at items in a full glimpse are on the first floors and then all the items in wooden packaging are at the bottom which you can pick up and pay.

Fourthly, their food is not too shabby either. For a company which is Swedish which specialises in DIY Furniture their food is pretty good. They sell relatively Swedish food (of course). Most of their meals contain meats (meatballs as well as hot dogs). It's not bad and its relatively cheap.

Sublime this shop..... really is!",Trustpilot_USA

"""Computer Says No"" . Having purchased wardrobes for one bedroom had them delivered and a damaged item replaced, which the delivery driver noticed when dropping off and experienced a tremendous fitting service I was ready to use the whole products and services again for a second bedroom. Just an observation to start, when a company buries its customer service telephone number deep in its website the company is not really concerned about customer service. Also you really find out the approach of an organisation to customer service when something goes wrong.
Having purchased the wardrobes and them being delivered I noticed there was another Pax Wardrobe which had been left incorrectly. By the way I live in a small flat and two Pax wardrobe boxes take up a lot of space and cause considerable inconvenience. After 48 hours I had not heard from IKEA regarding their Pax wardrobe I eventually found their telephone number and called them. My expectation would be that we would simply agree a date and time for pick and that would be it. The response from the operator was abysmal, the tone, the amount of information requested, the lack of any apology and the inability to offer a date and time when the wardrobe could be collected. Absolutely appalling. I had to put the phone down. All I heard was a 10.00am to 4.00pm window and an hour slot from another company. I paid my money to IKEA I am an IKEA customer, IKEA should resole the huge problem of an unwanted Pax Wardrobe. Having put the phone down. I emailed IKEA giving them 3 dates when it would be convenient from my standpoint to collect the wardrobe. I got a response in over 24 hours, "" Unfortunately we cannot give a smaller timeslot than 10am - 4pm as this is set by the delivery company. We also use an automated routing system which plans our routes based on how much stock we have to deliver and where - we cannot override this"". So I am being told a human being cannot override a computer system. I am not bothered about IKEA's inflexible approach and their deliveries, I have a wardrobe of theirs which I have stored for nearly 5 days and is very inconvenient and will be even more so tomorrow when the fitters come to install my wardrobe. My questions to readers is; am being unreasonable to expect a slot from IKEA which means I am not sitting waiting 10.00am to 4.00pm for some other organisation to contact me.

In the restaurant:
- there was food over the floor where we were being serviced,
- the guy serving was rubbing his face and drinking from a can of coke placed on the counter then touching the top of our plates leaving greasy finger marks.
- Nobody could find a clean glass to drink from, there was a queue of people. The cutlery was just as disgusting with bits of food.
- When I complained a member of staff snatched the glass from my hand and said 'it's just potluck'.
- Not a single table was clean and most were empty, I had to clean my own table.
- The person who took our payment didn't even give a receipt.
- I complained to the manager who was doing the dishes while other staff stood around doing nothing. She got defensive and blamed it on a short staff or it was busy earlier...",Trustpilot_USA

We spent over £600 on wardobes and a chest of drawers, we have just had to arrange our 5th delivery attempt. Reasons for this have been that the delivery company lied about attempting to deliver, then the goods were damaged, then we have had two cases of not all the items being in the van so we are still waiting on two items. I have spent hours on the phone to customer service where one guy hung up on me after explaining the issues in detail, having to recall and re-explain...

I am heavily pregnant and we are desperatly trying to get our house ready for the babies arrival, we have had no apology other than 4 lots of £30 'waste of day' compensation - which is not good enough...

On assembling one item I accidentally snapped a plastic part.
Called customer services, no hold time, straight through and couldn't have been more helpful. Arranged for delivery of whole new item and return of the now faulty one at the same time.
Later that day on assembling a desk that had to be purchased in two parts, I saw that we'd picked up one in the wrong colour.
Back on the phone and once again great service and arranged for correct colour unit to be delivered/wrong one returned. No charge for either. Both the deliveries within 3 days of phone call.
Even though both instances were our mistakes, and were purchased in store (and generally would need to be returned to store) they really went above and beyond to help.
Actually, best customer service I've received from a large company in a long time.",Trustpilot_USA

Hi, Lennart. Your case is being managed by our specialists in the kitchen department and they are working to give you the best solution for your problem and they will contact you ASAP. On the other hand, if you want to make a reclaim, you can do so whenever you want from the customer service desk of your store.

Me, SAT 09:18
Hi, the delivery is already, finally done. I think it would be decent that IKEA give me a really good compensation for this crazy delay and the poor customer service.

IKEA, SAT 12:50
Good news! Unfortunately, if you need to make claim it should be directly at the customer desk of your nearest store.

Me, SAT 13:03
I'm not going to talk to some random person (with no authority) at the customer desk. That would be MORE waste of my time. You should be able to sort this out here and now.

IKEA, SAT 15:11
There, you'll be able to fill a complain form that will be checked by the managers of customer service. After that, you will receive a letter with the answer. Because it has to be signed, we cannot manage it by this way.

Me, SAT 16:32
What do you mean? Because it has to be signed. That’s just to make it difficult for us customers. IKEA knows perfectly well what has happened. Fact is IKEA made an incredible mess of this and now you try to tell me to travel 50 mins in each direction, just because IKEA don’t immediately recognise a total failure. Sort this out!

IKEA, SAT 21:17
Hello! In relation to your query, we inform you that in order to file an official complaint it is necessary to go to the Customer Service desk at your nearest IKEA store: A complaint is an official document that must be written and signed by the customer, so it is not possible to carry out this type of action by telephone or through our social media. Thank you.

Me, SUN 12:18
I don't agree.
YOU say that a complaint has to be signed at the Customer Service desk in an IKEA store.
All decent companies realize when they have caused an unreasonable amount of inconveniance to a customer (check your logs if you want).

Waiting for deliveries (that did not happened) in the house for 5 times, 4 hours each time. 20 hours waisted
Spend approximately 3 hours in phone with IKEA.
Final delivery, 50 days after the promised 6 weeks delivery time.

Therefore, you should offer a compensation without me asking for it.

Instead you say to me:
Get in your car, drive 50 minutes, 62 km.
Go to Customer Service desk and write a complaint, no idea about waiting time, so I put 20 minutes (to little).
Drive back, same time and distance.
Which adds another 2 hours waisted, plus the costs to drive 124 km.

In order to, MAYBE, get a compensation.",Trustpilot_USA

"Appalling Customer Service . I have to say that customer service for something on line is appalling at the least!
We have been very good customers of yours over years and this might be the final straw.
I ordered something that had to be delivered down to us in the Southwest, making arrangements and waiting the time for the delivery down here. Only to find when it was delivered that an item the Main item was omitted. After waiting on line for over a half hour it was told to me that the order for the Ivar piece #892-482-05 I had ordered your fulfilment department had made a mistake on and deleted the order and credited my card back!
NO messages to this until I called you!
The item was NOT out of stock and still is IN stock! But the only solution was to inconvenience me more by issuing me a gift card for the £35 additional delivery fee with a delay of up to 10 days before the card would arrive before I could again make arrangements to order it and then set up for another delivery down here!

In this day and age you would think you could take the order and omit the delivery charge and I would have been with the item by now. But no such luck. Chris who I just spoke to in your after order department could not have been less helpful! Only giving me the normal guidelines to what has already been told to me.

I am still waiting this gift card and most likely will chuck it in the bin!

If you read the testimonials on this page you will see that a lot of people actually NEVER receive their goods.

I will never order ANYTHING from IKEA again.
I think the worst thing is that it really reveals how these brand identities are just FICTION.
Feel very disappointed that the whole brand identity is just fake.
I feel like I've been deceived.
Good luck.",Trustpilot_USA

"One star for delivery... if you need something go instore1 . One star for delivery. Love Ikea however delivery is dreadful. Ordered a Hemnes day bed that was due to be delivered 27/09. When it arrived, 2 boxes were missing and we were sent two of parcel number 2. Ordered for Thursday for the spare room, as we have guests coming the next day for the weekend and now I am on hold to customer services. It's already been about 20 minutes and no sign of them picking up any time soon. If you are going to charge £35 for delivery AT LEAST GET IT RIGHT!",Trustpilot_USA
"IKEA is the home of intelligence . I have been a huge Scandi Modernist when it comes to home shopping. I love IKEA for its fantastic ideas, minimalistic designs and economical pricing. For furniture and home décor which is inherent to change over time, I find IKEA a cool and creative place to buy things to make your home beautiful and a hub of creativity. My local store is GATESHEAD and I have received fantastic service that's includes knowledge from staff, ideas, and at the checkouts. I love their restaurant because we can spend time with kids during shopping and it is not expensive either. I have ordered for home delivery and in all fairness, the delivery is expensive which is only downside about IKEA but has been okay and on time. I bundled up a big order so it was economical as compared to other providers. We recently bought a sofa bed which was not expensive (£350) with storage and cushions and its the best thing I have had lately compared to a leather sofa from Barker and Stonehouse which costed over £2000 and never came with fire tags and I had to pay £20 to remove it because no one would buy or take in for charity without the tags plus was so uncomfortable apart from looking slick. Some of the kitchenware in IKEA is so creative especially for space saving in your house. I visit IKEA for their ideas more than anything.

In this age of trends, IKEA is my go to place.",Trustpilot_USA
"IKEA NEVER AGAIN !!! . Unbelievable !‼ I bought an office desk from Ikea website (order number 306900564) on 8/22 with estimate delivery on 9/3. Not receiving it as planned, I contacted Ikea several times and, finally, I was informed that my package would be delivered on 9/26. On 9/25 I got a call to confirm the delivered time. Since the package was NOT delivered, I contacted The Delivery Company again and the attendant told me that the driver truck was sick, they don't have anyone available to deliver the package and there isn't an estimated date to be delivered. It was my last attempt to receive my product. I am contacting my credit card company to refund the supposed purchase.",Trustpilot_USA

I wish I had googled this before I selected this option. It's rather expensive and it DOES NOT WORK. They rescheduled my delivery three times, each time they would say they were not able to deliver because I wasn't home - when I definitely was! I spent over 10 hours on the phone with them in total, and at some point, they started giving other excuses such as not having products in stock. By the end, my order has been postponed to be delivered about a month after the original date. When I decided to cancel, I had to stay on the line for 3 hours while they transferred me and made me wait and wait. AWFUL experience that left me with no furniture in my new apartment for over a month.",Trustpilot_USA
"By far the worst shopping experience I've had . EVERY step of the way has had issues, from ongoing delayed deliveries, missing items, lack of updates from IKEA on delays and missing items, difficulty in reaching customer service to enquire on said delays/items, inability of staff to properly follow through with pick-ups/refunds therefore resulting in delayed pick-ups and refunds, missing parts or parts that were not finished being cut, etc. Like others, I have had to waste hours, days and much energy waiting for deliveries that never showed up, putting aside tasks I could have completed had the schedule been adhered to or updates on a modified schedule at least been provided to me. I am overdue compensation for this trouble. Like others, I'll be justifiably reporting IKEA to the BBB and FTC and publishing bad reviews wherever I can. The first and last time I'll be shopping at IKEA. And I hope IKEA soon gets what it deserves: to be shut down.",Trustpilot_USA

"I was alarmed as to how I could… . I was alarmed as to how I could purchase a kitchen knife (medium sized) and not be questioned or checked for ID at the Thurrock ikea store. This is despite a service agent being very closeby the self service desk. There was also no prompts by the machine to alert the service agent. This is shocking and I really feel ikea should monitor who is purchasing items that could, in the wrong hand be used for other purposes.",Trustpilot_USA
"Generally okay. . This year is the first time I've ever bought anything from ikea. I've had three deliveries in total this year and they've been generally problem free. The price for delivery is extortionate though at £35 for heavy items but delivery is fairly straightforward. They give you a slot and they'll take your items to your room of your choice. The furniture is good quality and I've been quite impressed with them. The only slight problem I had was with Parcelforce who were supposed to deliver a small parcel. The day they were supposed to come, I heard nothing all day. Tried making contact with ikea which seemed impossible as their email system was down and I didn't fancy spending 20 minutes in a call queue. In the end, their twitter page eventually told me they were having problems with parcel force. I eventually got the parcel 4 days later. Still, it would have been nice to have been told this information.",Trustpilot_USA

"AVOID at all costs! . IKEA: how NOT to do business.

Ikea have a very shabby reputation for service, and deservedly so.

We made the mistake of ordering online for a second time hoping that things have improved. NEVER AGAIN!!!!

The first time the problems were in regards to the delivery truck never visiting us! Then IKEA claiming there is no other slot for the next couple of weeks, even though it was there fault since both my wife and me were at home waiting. A month later we managed to have our issue resolved.

This time the original weekend delivery date was moved to a Wednesday without any warning! Both me and my wife of course work that day. I have had to wait on the phone for almost two hours to just be connected to an agent!!!! I am trying to cancel the order and be done with this awful company called IKEA!

And, they use Parcel Force - the scourge of carriers in the UK.

"I wish I had read these reviews.... . I wish I had read these reviews or even googled 'Ikea customer service' and then I would NEVER have placed an order with Ikea.

We placed an order and both took the day off work as we had over 50 items arriving. We had booked in for the taskrabbit assembly too. The day came and we had no contact within our 11am-3pm slot so called customer services. After listening to Abba for 30 mins we got through to Cheryl and she said it will come today... there have been issues but don't worry yours isn't affected. What a total lie. 8pm and nothing so called back and she said they have to re-order. We said as they have wasted our day (plus cancelled hospital appointments) that we want a Saturday delivery. I have just had a text to say it's coming on a Wednesday. Lost the energy to argue and will have to take ANOTHER day off work because Ikea are so incompetent. How they are still allowed to trade is beyond me.

"HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE . On Saturday the 08th of September of 2018, I bought a wardrobe (model: BRIMNES wardrobe/3drs 117x190 oak effect) and booked also the delivery service (£35) to get it delivered to my place one week later on Friday the 14th of September.

I was told I would get it between 7 and 11am; since I had to work, I asked a friend of mine to stay and wait for the parcel as it wouldn’t be later than 11am, so she had time enough to go to her appointments. At around 10:30am I received a call from the driver saying that they were literally 10 meters away from my place but they couldn’t find my flat. Even though I have never experienced this situation before because all the deliveries always arrive without any issues, I did explained him what the street was and gave him enough indications to find my place. Without giving me a chance to explain that I had someone waiting for him, he did hang up the phone and he wouldn’t pick up the phone again at all.

My friend stayed until 2:30pm and nobody came; she missed one of her appointments. We both were trying to reach the driver but he wouldn’t answer; he finally did, saying to her that they were coming back on a smaller van, even though there’s no need as my street is big enough, also I live just next to the corner, the could have parked there and walk the 2 meters between the corner and my door; my friend wouldn’t have mind go and help them to bring the boxes up.

I went to the IKEA contact page on the website where I did found an email, the same that appears on the confirmation email when I bought the wardrobe, as a “customer service” channel. I did tried to send an email and the response I got (and this happened twice) was: “This mailbox does not accept direct emails, so your email has been removed.” (see screenshot attached); so, what is the purpose of this email?, is it just a placeholder so the customers think you actually offer a service?.

I tried also the live chat, but I had to refresh the page several times until it would appears and disappears suddenly, I’ve managed to connect only twice, even though I’ve tried all day. The first time it was at around 12 the person in the chat told me they were 30 min away; I had my friend waiting for another hour and they never came; so he lied to me, he had no idea where the drivers were and he promised me they were just around the corner. After an hour of waiting, I did tried to contact someone again, through email. (I got the same response than before), through phone (never a response) and through the chat, which again appeared and disappeared constantly. I finally managed to talk to someone on the chat for the second time, he told me again that they were very close, I did tell him the situation, he told me again that they were “on the drop”, another one lying to me. He finally said that he could only follow the track, so they never talked to the drivers, they had no idea, and they were only trying to calm me down so I wouldn’t carry on complaining.

It wasn’t until almost 5pm that I finally managed to get an answer from the driver, he said they were coming during the evening or first thing on Saturday morning and that he will call me back to let me know. Friday evening passed, not a single call, text message or email. Saturday morning came, same thing. When I went to check my “delivery status” it said: “we couldn’t deliver your parcel, for more information please contact us”. How come it has to be me who contact you if you weren’t the ones who didn’t deliver the parcel the day you had to.

I did pay £35 extra to get it delivered at my door on Friday and it never happened, and I am the one who has to contact you; and how?, the email doesn’t work, you never answer the phone and the live chat barely works. Completely unacceptable. If you are not able to deliver the parcel as you promised, you are the ones who have to contact the client, let them know the issues and offer a new solution; instead, I had to spend at least 20 min on the phone on just waiting until someone could “help” me. The only solution was waiting until the EARLIEST delivery date which is Thursday the 20th September, almost a week later than what I needed it. I had to ask for a new delivery date, how come you didn’t put me on the list for next delivery?.

I have all my clothes and belongings all over the floor in my room since Friday. I had to ask for the day off to be at home when it gets finally delivered because they gave me a very specific time, first, between 9am and 3pm, and finally yesterday, between 11am and 3pm. Asking for the day off means I don’t get paid for this day; I can’t work from home and I have to spend almost all day at home just waiting. My friend lost all her day on Friday last week, and I will lose mine and my money tomorrow.

On top of all this, I booked a furniture assembly for last Sunday in the morning (through IKEA website with TaskRabbit), I had to cancel it and start all over again. They are coming tomorrow at 4pm and I really hope my wardrobe is been delivered by then.

If I knew all this would happen, I would probably go to IKEA and take a taxi cab with me. Probably, it would be cheaper and, obviously, faster. But I did trust in your services and the disappointment was massive.

The only way I found to get attention was posting comments on almost every single picture on Facebook, as Twitter wouldn’t work neither or any other of the channels mentioned before. I had to become an annoying person to get someone to talk to me.",Trustpilot_USA
"DON'T USE PARCELFORCE FOR YOUR… . DON'T USE PARCELFORCE FOR YOUR DELIVERIES

Absolutely disgusted!

i placed an order with IKEA. they use this shower! my wife was at home and heard someone outside our front door, she reached the door in time to see a ""sorry we missed you card"" being pushed through the letter box, when she opened the door the driver almost died! she asked where the parcel was to be told ""i don;t have your f*ing parcel!"" she chased him down the stairs . as much as she could as she is disabled. he kept swearing at her. she told him she would complain and he said ""go ahead, it won't get you anywhere"" He tried to drive at her in his van.

Is this really the behaviour we should expect? Emerges the lazy so and so didn't want to carry the parcel upstairs so dumped it at a ground floor appt.

"So I buy the Melltrop table . So I buy the Melltrop table. I was hesitant because I’ve had bad experiences with IKEA assembly before, but I gave them a go. Of course, as I’m installing, the last table leg will not screw in, even a little, but was stripped in the factory. I don’t have a car, so I ride my BIKE 50 minutes to IKEA for one thing: a new table leg. If I was rich, I wouldn’t be buying 25$ tables, and riding this many miles for a leg, would I? No, I am poor, and cannot afford the time or the table but I ride out anyway, determined to decorate my crappy Portland apartment.
Upon arrival I am told they can help me, great! A nice blonde girl then asks me if all 4 table legs are the same. I have 0 idea, I told her I don’t know. THE TINIEST bit of product knowledge THIS EMPLOYEE SHOULD HAVE could have saved me. Me, being very intelligent but underprivileged, think quick to say: hey, here is the stripped leg. I carried it all the way here so YOU CAN COMPARE IT NOW. Do you think they followed through with the correct leg? OF COURSE NOT? Why be even a little intelligent and listen to me when you can be a stupid IKEA employee? She tells me to wait 20 minutes, takes my phone number to call me, and I leave. 45 minutes later: NO PHONE CALL. I decide to walk back in.
Panic stricken, the girl tells me she has my leg. I get back to my apartment: still my table lays on the floor because THIS IS THE WRONG LEG.
I don’t have a car, the level of inconvenience caused me by IKEA, specifically it’s product-unaware employees, is unforgivable. So many chances I’ve given Ikea. As long as I live, I will never, ever, buy IKEA furniture. I am going to burn that table to the ground someday, just because I dislike IKEA that much. I have a table I paid for, that is 100% unusable, even after 2 hours of biking and 45 minutes of waiting. So, so, so displeased. I will be posting this review everywhere possible.

We spent over 30 hours on the phone trying to straighten it all out and in the end we were offered $300 gift certificate and our delivery fee refunded, less than 5% of our purchase price, they should be giving us a much better compensation than this. Once the compensation was agreed upon I was told it would take a week. Today marks 4 weeks and we have seen nothing. They seem so nice on the phone and seem like they will help but nothing happens, our order was canceled multiple times internally with out explanation. Don't plan on getting responses via email either. Sadly they rarely if at all respond to them.

"no show on delivery, no answering phone . I purchased my furniture in store and scheduled to have my furniture delivered on 9/14 from College Park, MD IKEA and ikea called me to confirm delivered time on 9/12. I was even given 5 different time slots to pick when to deliver to my home. On 9/14, I took time off from work. The furniture was supposed to arrive in the morning. We waited until afternoon, had to cancel our other appointment in the afternoon. Until the end of day, 9pm, we didnot see our furniture nor anybody call us. During the time, we called both the delivery company and ikea. No answer from both company. The delivery company has an answer machine but never return my call. Ikea simple hang up the phone with message saying they are too busy to answer. (I have call ikea many times after that, 9 out of 10 time I was hang up after the brief ""too busy"" message. I think they should at least give me option to on hold or be called back.)
Anyway, after finally get in touch with the delivery company and ikea. They offer different story each time, and always blame the other company.
The bottom line is, they had contact me 2 days prior delivery. If they could not put items together at warehouse in time, they should contact me. The worst case, the delivery company and IKEA should call me on the scheduled delivery day when they find out they could not do delivery that day. They should also fix the answering service. In this time of age, people complain being talking to computer, being hold for too long. IKEA does not give these options, they simply hang up.

"Unacceptably poor customer “service” . Had I known the delivery company IKEA works with and it’s telephone support network was so sub-par, I would have saved myself the 4 hours I spent waiting for my order today and simply gone to the store. After not receiving any update on my order past my due delivery time, I called IKEA customer service only to be informed that my item had not been collected that morning. If that was the case, it would have been really considerate had someone contacted me to let me know rather than leaving me to wait all day and requiring me to call up to find out where my items were. Sandy, the customer service representative I called then assured me my items would be delivered on Monday evening and I would be able to receive a shipping refund if I stayed on the line. Of course, as soon as she tried to transfer me the call dropped so I spent a further 50 minutes on hold trying to reach a new representative only to be told it wasn’t IKEA’s responsibility but the shipping company and I would have to reschedule directly with them. I’m absolutely disgusted with the level of customer service I have received from the company and the company IKEA uses to ship your products. As far as I am concerned, I paid IKEA for my order and my shipping, therefore it is IKEA’s responsibility to deliver my order in full at the scheduled time and if not, IKEA should have let me know instead of wasting my day. It’s not long till my baby is due, the furniture I ordered was for the nursery and I’m supposed to be having friends around tomorrow to help me set up everything and have fun getting ready for the arrival of my baby. I am so upset and disappointed that I have to cancel this due to IKEAs incompetence. The items I ordered from Target and Walmart on the very same day arrived over a week ago...and the shipping was free. This is absolutely the last time I ever order anything from IKEA online and the experience has left me feeling so let down I honestly don’t think I ever want to give any money to this store again.

11:31:12 am Kayleigh: Hej, thanks for contacting IKEA WEBCHAT, you’ve connected with Kayleigh. How can I assist you?
11:34:03 am jared lewis: i have purchased an Alex desk on saturday from your cardiff store. When it has been assembled the dwell holes in the top of the desk were not drilled deep enough by you the manufacturer and have therefore caused 4 dents in the top surface of the desk. i live 100 miles away from cardiff and am not prepared to drive all the way to cardiff to return the item. i can however send you a photograph and a copy of the receipt via email.
11:35:08 am Kayleigh: I am sorry to hear this. Do you have the article number for the item please
11:35:42 am jared lewis: yes its : 902.607.10
11:36:20 am Kayleigh: Thank you. Is it just a replacement top panel that is required?
11:37:06 am jared lewis: no as i was glueing it together as it was put together. so it will not just detach which is a shame.
11:38:32 am Kayleigh: Ok if you have glued the item then there is nothing we can do unfortunately. If you wish to return the item back to the store it would be at their discretion should they wish to assist you further
11:42:06 am jared lewis: that is completely unfair. i have purchased a lot of items from ikea and always glued the dowel joints with wood glue as this is good practice for the item to stay in tact for the long term. the glue has not caused the damage. the item being manufactured faulty is the problem. I have paid on my credit card so can go down the route of claiming the money back through them if you would prefer, as i now have written evidence that you are not prepared to help.
11:43:28 am Kayleigh: I do appreciate that however we do not advise for the item to be glued in any way as this voids the guarantee of the item
11:43:54 am jared lewis: it does not say that on any of the instructions i received.
11:44:41 am Kayleigh: It does not say to use glue, It advises of the parts that are required to assemble the items and that is not one of them.
11:48:21 am jared lewis: that is irrelevant you've just told me that the guarantee is voided if i use glue. which i have not been told on the instructions. if this was on the instructions then you would have a valid point. but it is not!! Using Pva Glue for Dowelled wood joints is good practice. any carpenter will tell you that. the item is faulty. If you are not prepared to either issue a refund or send out a replacement, then i will either have to contact my credit card company as stated previously or contact traded standards. if you personally cannot help me to resolve this Kayleigh then please can you get a manager to contact me. I am not a happy customer.
11:49:57 am Kayleigh: I understand your frustration and we could help you with regards to the item had you not glued this together by sending a replacement top panel. However as this has been done there is nothing more we can do. I apologise for this. As previously advised if you wish to visit your local store for assistance it would be at their discretion should they wish to assist you further however there is nothing further we can do from here.
11:53:19 am jared lewis: can you please get a manger to contact me. If you think i am going to do a 200 mile round trip then i will expect to be compensated for my mileage at £0.45 a mile on top of the refund/exchange. I would like to speak to your line manager as i am not happy. you can get him/her to call me. but i will be taking this further if i am compensated for a faulty item as a customer. this was not the only item i purchased when i visited the cardiff store. so i will be arranging a refund for everything not just this item.
11:54:59 am Kayleigh: If you wish to speak to a manager you will need to call us on 0203 645 0000.
11:57:31 am jared lewis: I've been waiting on the phone for 25 minutes before i did this online chat!!! i don't think your customer service is good at all i think i would have spent my time better reviewing the very poor customer service i have had from ikea on the internet for every body to see how poor you are . i would like you to arrange a manger to call me please to resolve this.

"WARNING DO NOT SHOP WITH IKEA ONLINE! . WARNING DO NOT SHOP WITH IKEA ONLINE!

Ikea takes the prize for the worst online company! I placed an order for a wardrobe to be given a delivery between 1pm and 5pm in 4 days time. The 4 days went, 5pm came, no delivery - 1 hour waiting in the queue to speak to someone, only to be told that it would be coming, here's £20 compensation. 8pm came, no delivery, another hour on the phone, only to be told that the drivers had run out of time and that I should re-schedule (too late to do today), which would more likely be in 4 days time. Cancelled order, offered £30 compensation for wasting 6 hours (+1 hour writing an email to the CEO) of my time for nothing.

Shopping with Ikea online is a waste of time and effort and it leaves you feeling incredibly angry and frustrated for being such a fool for trying it. I just wish I'd checked here before attempting it. Why they waste their time offering this terrible ""service"", I have no idea. If they didn't offer it, I'd have gone into a store and I'd be happy now, and more fulfilled having done something useful in those 7 hours!",Trustpilot_USA

"Terrible Service . Terrible Service
I had ordered a delivery worth quite a substantial amount of money which was meant to be delivered between 7am and 11am on the 31st August. After having a missed call from the driver I rang him back later to which he told me three different stories, one stating he had attempted delivery, the second saying he could not find the house and the third saying he would ring back in ten minutes with a solution. The driver did not ring back and actively rejected my calls.
I then decided to web chat with customer services. This was another terrible experience. I was made to feel as though the whole situation was my own fault. The operator used my name at the end of each sentence in a patronising tone without even asking if she could address me by my first name. When asked what I could do about my delivery she stated the driver would ring me. When I asked what to do if this doesn’t happen she simply replied “they will ring” offering me no alternative solution or support. When asked about a refund the operator said I could only have a partial refund when my goods arrived, despite not giving me any information on how to do this. The whole customer service experience online and with the delivery man was awful with no concern or care for my situation.
I then waited on hold for around half an hour to the customer service phone team. I was then told at around 16:00 that the driver was only on drop 1 and that I was drop 2. I wasn’t quite sure how this was possible considering the driver told me he had already been this morning.
After several phone calls to customer services at 20:30 I was told that the driver had said I had not answered phone calls and stated he left voicemails which is completely untrue. I then had to reorganise my delivery and now won’t be receiving my goods until NEXT FRIDAY! I now have to wait a whole week more for a delivery due this morning. This is absolutely unacceptable and no refund has been offered.
Overall I feel the company lack communication, compassion and organisation and I hope to never experience this level of customer service again.",Trustpilot_USA

Even she seemed surprised that I was still doggedly hanging on by the time she returned to my call. This morning, I've been calling since 8am as there are no online chat agents apparently, and the wait times have been between 20 and 30 minutes each time I've tried getting through.

The staff at IKEA are clearly not trained correctly. It was explained to me that they are unable to call customers to make them aware if their delivery won’t be turning because their system doesn’t flag this up!

"Customer Services a huge letdown. . I wish I’d thought of checking out Ikea on trustpilot before ordering online.
On 14th August I ordered a coffee table online as there were none available in my local store ( Belfast).
I opted to collect it myself on 20th . I arrived instore after 2pm and was told it wasn’t yet instore....no text or email to let me know. Fortunately I’d a few other things to get so headed into the store. I happened to notice that my ordered item was available instore in a colour I assumed had been discontinued. I bought it and went back to the Collection point to say I no longer wanted the one I’d ordered. The assistant said I could easily cancel it by phone or email.
No matter which, of several, numbers I phoned the automated voice said there was approx.
a 30 minute wait! Decided to email. No reply in next 2 days. Emailed again......still waiting for even an automated acknowledgement.
I’d no option but to waste time and petrol returning to store, waiting at Collection point ( had to ask passing assistant if it would be manned soon ) and then joining queue at Returns to get a refund!
Most disappointing of all was the attitude from each assistant, especially the one who had previously suggested phoning or emailing customer services. Neither was in the least sympathetic and neither even apologised on behalf of Ikea. I was polite and friendly throughout....at a loss to understand this uninterested attitude, and so unlike the helpfulness of staff throughout the store.

In brief a very large wardrobe and cabinetry were ordered & delivered in a timely & appropriate fashion, then everything was swiftly assembled by my Son-in-Law and they were both pleased overall.
However my Daughter especially is absolutely heart broken at the subsequent follow-up order and replacement parts fiasco.
From attempts to get through to customer service to shocking condition of products upon arrival.
In terms of trying to contact customer services unless you have it would appear on average 45 minutes to waste hanging on the telephone just waiting for your call to be handled, furthermore taking time away from work waiting in all day for your pre-scheduled consignments to ultimately not arrive as promised on several occasions.

YOU will fall into their endless pit of NO CUSTOMER SERVICE that will eat you alive. ORLANDO STORE #145 still has not responded to ONE of the four phone messages I have left over the last 2 weeks. WHAT??? anyway I guess my only option is to make the 60 mile trek (each way) again tomorrow and see if the stuff I am missing (all 71 pieces) are in stock and I will cancel my order and let it die in the XPO IKEA warehouse cemetery. Hope you had your LOL for the day, unfortunately from the research i have done this HORROR is the NORM with IKEA, not the exception. WhAt A sHAMe!!!

I recently ordered a few furniture through IKEA. After the three days pass from the delivery date, I called IKEA's customer service asking where are my shipments. First of all, to find out it did not even leave their trailer to be delivered, took me about 2 hours on the phone waiting. I asked if I could cancel the order since it would be so much easier and quicker to just go to the store and pick them up myself. Unfortunately, they said they couldn't refund me the delivery fee since my items are already in the trailer! WHAT?!

Well, Okay.. then why give delivery date options? Why isn't there a better solution? Now I am just waiting again for the items to be delivered. NOT TO MENTION, the driver called me on the day of actual delivery day saying He is running behind. and he should be bringing the items a day after.

"The absolute worst customer service… . The absolute worst customer service I've ever experienced.

I placed my order on July 9th. On the 12th, I received an email that said my order had shipped and I would be receiving a phone call regarding my delivery details in the next few days.

On July 17th, I received an automated phone call saying that my delivery would be there the next day between 12pm and 4pm. Stayed home and waited. Nothing. At 5 o'clock, I called the delivery company (North American Logistics). Apparently, they hadn't actually received the order from Ikea yet.

I tried calling Ikea customer service, but I just kept getting the same message that ""all circuits are busy."" Weird, I thought.

Two days later, I get the same automated call saying my order would be delivered between 11am and 3pm the next day. Sure enough, the same thing happens.

I called North American Logistics customer service again, and they said it looks like they still haven't received the order from Ikea.

I try again to get ahold of Ikea customer service, FINALLY get through, wait for a representative for over an hour only to be told there's nothing they can do, and they'll have someone from a different department call me back the next day.

Fine.

The next day comes. No one calls.

Honestly, the timeline wouldn't be a huge deal if 1) anyone at either company could tell me where the heck my order is, 2) I wasn't getting phone calls about scheduling a delivery that North American Logistics doesn't even have, and 3) I could get some semblance of a timeline in order to prepare. I've taken TWO afternoons off for this now for nothing.

Now I keep getting the runaround between the customer service departments at Ikea and North American Logistics. No one has a clue what's going on. This has been the worst order/delivery/customer service experience I've ever had.

Ikea had no problem taking my money, but they're having a serious issue with follow through.

I will never shop at Ikea (online) again, nor would I recommend it to anyone else.

UPDATE: I finally spoke with a helpful customer service agent at Ikea who was able to create a replacement order. She also offered (without me having to ask) to refund my original shipping fee of $59.

That said, I had a good experience ordering a sofa online (although labor intensive to make sure you are ordering correctly) and good with the delivery 125 miles away. Inexpensive for delivery which is a plus. Ordered a bed online for delivery within the St. Louis area. Mattress & pad came, no bed frame. Incredibly difficult to reach them.

7th July - Again they didn't turn up. No warning, No explanation. IKEA actually said the wardrobes had been fitted, until we offered to send photo of the boxes. Then they accepted they hadn't been fitted.

Rebooked AGAIN for 21st July. More confirmation they would arrive.

Fitters said they would be here.

21st July- The fitters didn't show up. AGAIN. IKEA said they were coming!!

Each time IKEA confirm the booking and reference number and say they will arrive.

Ordered £6k worth of kitchen and a bespoke worktop online and agreed a delivery date 6 weeks in advance. 3 days before it was due I was told some items were not in stock so would not get a complete kitchen then the day after (48 hours before I was expecting it!) I had 6 separate texts with 6 new delivery dates. I already had tradesmen booked in to fit the kitchen. After many calls to their very unhelpful service centre who didn't seem to know anything I was driven over edge and exercised my right to cancel the contract under the failed delivery clause.

"Terrible delivery issues! . This is my most recent email to the Ikea customer service just so you get an idea of how bad it’s been.

Hi there,

I’d like to make you aware of an ongoing situation regarding my delivery which has caused extreme stress, excess use of my own time and time out of my job.

I placed an order 23rd June to be delivered Saturday 30th. It didn’t turn up.

So I called customer services on Monday 2nd July to find out what was happening. Apparently they didn’t have the stock in the warehouse so obviously they couldn’t deliver. However, I was not made aware of this. The team member offered me £35 store credit which I have not received, and re ordered my delivery to come from the Lakeside store on Saturday 7th. It didn’t turn up so I called the Lakeside number provided in the email and they told me there was an error with the order. So they re ordered it for Tuesday 10th and offered £30 store credit which I have not received.

Monday 9th I called to make sure everything was right with my order and that it would arrive the next day. But the order was done wrong again and they re ordered it for Thursday 12th. No compensation offered. But this time the team member told me she had her supervisor check to make sure the order was placed correctly.

So today I was expecting my order to finally arrive, I had tracking sent to me. Then I check tracking just after 2pm and it tells me delivery failed. I call up, and am told they didn’t put my house number in and that’s why it failed. Refused to offer any more compensation in any form, even though I explained the situation and the issues before. And re ordered the delivery to arrive tomorrow, Friday 13th.

I called again this evening wanting to make a manger aware of the situation but was told they don’t have one, just a floor manager, but he can’t speak to me. So I should email this address.

This situation has taken so much of my personal time and caused so much stress, I’m heavily pregnant, and work 50 hours a week and shouldn’t have to chase team members mistakes twice a week without them contacting me. I’ve even taken a day off unpaid for one of your delivery promises which cost me over £85.

Please show this email to the highest possible of management as this situation is unacceptable and should not be down to me to fix every time and wait longer and longer for it to be fixed.

What has been done in terms of compensation is no where near enough for all of this hassle, and to be honest, I don’t want any more Ikea store credits as I don’t want to shop with you again. I want the furniture I ordered, the store credits I’m owed, and to be done compensated some other way.

Please listen back to all the phone calls as well if you record them to get an idea of the situation better.

I will be sending copies of this email to your CEO and Country Manager.

I contacted them and was eventually told it was due to a system error. Re-scheduled for 20th June. Did not arrive. Spent 2 hours on the phone to a helpful but super slow chap at Ikea who tried all sorts OD different avenues to get the kitchen to me to no avail. Now rescheduled for next week
Kitchen fitters were booked - they are owed for 8 wasted days at a cost of £3k. Time off my self employed business £400. No kitchen - living in a building site with a microwave for company.
Where are my 154 pieces of IKEA kitchen? Who knows.
Angry, upset, frustrated. Rest of building project was put on hold for the kitchen. Endless time wasting.
Very disappointed as I love IKEA products. The only way to complain is by Email as you never get to speak to anyone other than phone operators.
My advice - don't buy an IKEA kitchen!!",Trustpilot_USA
Ikea Malaga - A terrible Experience! . A terrible shopping Experience! 2 sofas and a footstool for a rental apartment. Delivery had boxes missed off. One sofa had all the nuts bolts and connectors missing. 4 phone calls nothing resolved. Took 1 hour 40 mins and 3 staff to resolve the following day at Customer services. The nuts and bolts connectors to be posted out after the next holiday renters arrive. All items removed at my expense to storage! Purchased another sofa for the rental.

"Display products not in stock . We went to buy a crib for our daughter who is expecting soon. We decided to get the Sniglar Beech crib and changing table which are inexpensive, and the changing table is small which was perfect for my daughter’s tight space. We picked out what we wanted from the display area and we to go get it from the pick-up area. Both products were out of stock. After some time, we finally found someone to assist us. She said the crib would be in stock in a couple of days but she had no idea about the changing table as it did not say in her system. I went back to get the crib and even though the changing table was available online I decided to wait a few days. Well, big mistake because not only did it not restock in-store but it went out of stock online. I emailed customer service and received a rather terse and unhelpful reply that said due to manufacturing issues the changing table would be out of stock until November. She offered no solution other than to wait until then. I was very disappointed because at this point the crib had been put together and we did not want to disassemble and return and the box was gone as well. Being a unique color, we are unable to match it so we are having to get a white changing from another store. Admittedly it is much nicer but it is also bigger and more expensive.
I do not plan to ever shop at IKEA again. My local store is like a maze. I find it confusing and stressful to shop there. Also, the rep was not sympatric or helpful. Her only solution was to wait 5 months which is not a good solution since the baby will be here in a few weeks. I do understand that there may be manufacturing issues out of their control but they offered no viable solution or concession to me. She refused to sell me the floor model or give any kind of credit or discount toward a more expensive item or any other thing that would have made me feel better about their company.",Trustpilot_USA
"Supremely inept with horrendous customer service . Father in law bought 2 new large wardrobes and bedside tables, paying for delivery to Southport which was quite the premium of 35 quid. For such a high delivery price you would expect a premium service but on delivery the guys taking everything upstairs noticed the wardrobe doors had not had any hinges packed. They instructed him to call Ikea directly there and then to report them missing and verified this while he was on the phone. Very apologetic they assured him they would be sent out monday morning and take 3-5 days delivery which in my opinion was the first poor customer service choice. It was their error not packing the hinges so the parts should have been sent out as special delivery guaranteed next day.
One week later, he had to call them again as the 3-5 days passed and no sign of the hinges. The call centre drone was very sorry but they hadn't even been sent out but would guarantee they went out monday via parcelforce and should get them in a couple of says. He would also process a £20 discount as a goodwill gesture.
Amazingly after another call just over an hour ago, he was told that (yep you guessed it) hadn't been sent out or 20 quid refund prompting him to go quite ballistic though not swearing, resulting in drone no 2 terminating the call.
How is it possible to have a company with the size and reputation of Ikea to be so blatantly uncaring and incompetent towards their customers? I can see why there are so many 1 star reviews as they are quite simply appalling. The mark of a company is when there is a problem how they rectify that to leave a positive impression on the customer to ensure they come back again. After this performance, none of our family or friends will be using this sorry excuse for a company and I encourage others not to either.",Trustpilot_USA

We had a delivery from Ikea the other day which contained multiple packages and boxes. After signing for delivery the driver walked out with our receipt and we realized an item was missing. When we called him (the driver)he hung up on us so we attempted to call Ikea customer service. The wait was 45 minutes so we attempted to file a complaint online, filled out the form and try to submit but the system was not working. Makes me wonder if Ikea""s management thinks their customers are ignorant and willing to accept terrible treatment? They will never get any business from us again.",Trustpilot_USA
watch the delivery times . Great store experience from really friendly staff - in sharp contrast to the online experience.

"The IKEA Delivery Service is a big SCAM! . Never ever EVER order from IKEA online. I am unaware of the in-store experience but I definitely know about the online store. First off, £35 delivery charge for what exactly? Petrol costs? Lifting up the items for you? What is the delivery charge paying for? Anyways I ordered a table, not too complex, a table top and legs. I ordered the table and I get the confirmation and all of the information and a delivery date & time. I wait patiently and go out of my way to wait between those hours. Waiting and waiting, no delivery. I call them and I ask, hello where is my table? They said that the table top wasn't in stock and they are going to get the table top and legs to me in a few days. So here I am a bit satisfied that they are going to get the table top in stock to deliver, oh was I wrong. Another delivery date missed. Called them again and they offered compensation, thank you for that e-Voucher for YOUR store I don't really want since your service isn't worth any money. They say it will be delivered the next day, oh surprise surprise ladies and gentleman, NO DELIVERY. This is when I am just fed up already, a company which is this popular should not be this poor in service and quality. The way they deal with their delivery services is abysmal. You'd think it's organized by a bunch of wannabe business people. I mean that's probably correct. Anyways they told me they will try to deliver again on another date, the day comes, it's a sunny day and I am waiting patiently, I received a text message saying my delivery is on the way and I can use this tracking site to watch where the truck is going. I open the site up and I can see the truck and it's surprisingly on the way, I then keep refreshing it obsessively because I really crave to have something I paid my money for! Believe it or not. I then see it approach the road near my house (this is about 100 meters away) a literal 1-minute drive to my house. Before you know it, bobs your uncle and off they drive back to the warehouse and another unsuccessful delivery date. The most useless, preposterous, poor example of a multi-millionaire company.

"IKEA online ordering is a nightmare. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. . We attempted to order online, but the website continually failed. After hours of frustration, we decided to order via phone. The representative was unable to spell our street address repeatedly (it's 3 letters) and was generally all over the place. We confirmed that they had the shipping address verbally, they read it back to us letter for letter. We confirmed that the shipping address is in fact different from the billing address.

3 weeks later we get a call that our deliver has arrived. Only its 3 states away.

They delivered our purchase to the billing address, NOT the shipping address. To be clear, we confirmed that they had the correct shipping address multiple times. The contracted shipper just... couldn't be bothered to differentiate between the shipping and billing address.

IKEA's customer service was nothing short of horrendous. After waiting on hold for hours (average wait time is 80 minutes, all the while they tell you how ""fast and easy"" online ordering is) the representative say they have fixed the address and we will receive our order in 2 days. Okay.

We get the confirmation minutes later, again, with the wrong address. Call again. Wait on the phone another hour and a half. Now the Ikea rep says they can't change the address. Okay?

Wait on hold another 30 minutes. Ask to cancel the order (because this company is horrible and won't get another dime of business from us). Hold 30 minutes. Screw. This. Company. Their delivery service is garbage and their customer service is garbage.

Having a different billing and delivery address is not complicated. I mean... this is a furniture company... they should be able to deal with customers who have recently moved. The fact that our purchase was delivered to the wrong address, and then the company repeatedly failed to remedy the situation, is inexcusable. Customer service just blames the contracted shipping company, but then gives no contact information to speak directly to the shipper. Zero accountability, and we had to FIGHT to get the full expense back to us for what is clearly a complete failure on the part of the seller. We'll see if we even get a refund.

Will never do business with this company again, and advise others to steer wide clear. Horrible business who could care less about customers. Disgusting business... pay more to a company that has a shred of respect for their customers or buy second hand.",Trustpilot_USA

"Honestly if you want to order an Ikea… . Honestly if you want to order an Ikea kitchen you’d be better off copying their methods and teaching yourself how to make a kitchen from scratch because you’ll get it quicker than buying one from them.

My order should have been delivered 3 times and I have been let down all 3 times, I was offered a poor level of compensation considering the circumstances and the value of my order. I have been on the phone for approximately 5-6 hours chasing this order and trying to resolve issues with them.

My order was modified 3 times by cancelling items on it as they do not have them in stock and couldn’t tell me when they would have them in stock. I have been patient and understood their issues but my kitchen was finally meant to be delivered tomorrow but due to an internal error it was put back to next Monday.

They literally cancel an order of over 100 items if they don’t have 1 bit in stock!

The level of customer service I have received has varied but one guy really put the icing on the cake by starting the conversation by saying “yeah I’ve got bad news and bad news for you” how professional is that?

And to top it all off it takes 10 days to get your money back and unfortunately I do not have the money to go and purchase another kitchen whilst Ikea process my refund.

Long and short of it don’t bother! Plant some trees wait for them to grow and in the mean time master you’re carpentry skills because I guarantee you’ll get your kitchen before I do!

If someone high up in Ikea wishes to contact me please feel free to do so as I’d love to speak to you.

"Probably worst customer service I've experienced, ever. . There are many layers to the issues I have experienced with IKEA, but best to start from the beginning.

1.) I had ordered items from them at the beginning of May, for delivery at the end of May. I was sent an email confirming that the delivery would be made. I took a day of annual leave to receive the items, however they never arrived. I called in to ask them about the status of the delivery, whereupon I was told that the delivery truck was stuck in traffic. I waited for another hour and then called again, at which point I was told that the delivery would not be made due to a glitch. I explained that I had arranged for people to come over and assist with the furniture (who were travelling from quite a distance away), and the fact that I had to take annual leave to receive the delivery. They basically showed no empathy and said that they would deliver the items on the following Sunday and would refund me the delivery fee. When I explained to them that I now had no furniture and that they should have communicated the glitch to me so that I could make alternate arrangements and cancel the people coming to assemble, they basically shrugged it off.

2.) I had finally got through to someone on the phone who was helpful and understood the inconvenience caused. He agreed to refund the costs of an air mattress...to date I have still not received my refund, after submitting the invoice twice. The emails that come from the IKEA customer services are all generic and do not show any empathy, all they were willing to do is hammer home that these ""glitches"" happen and they could only refund me the delivery costs. When I explained to them that I cannot even unpack my new house because I have no furniture, they didn't care.

3.) Sunday arrives and my delivery is made. Well, only one item out of 15. When I called them to ask where everything else is, they basically said there was another error and it will be delivered the following Friday. This would now mean another week of no furniture and no bed. When I explained to the customer service representative that this was now ridiculous and I wanted some form of compensation, I was once again hit by the rigid: ""only delivery fee can be refunded"". Once again no empathy is shown and I had people over on the Sunday to once again assist me with the assembly.
4.) Today, out of the blue, I receive an email stating that the delivery date has now been changed to Sunday. Once again I have to now reschedule plans because they have decided to change my delivery without telling me why. Also, I won't be able to build my furniture on Sunday and as such I will now have another week with no bed and clothes and computers on the floor.

My issue here is that nobody cares from IKEA. The attitude is certainly not consumer friendly, and given their volume of business, they genuinely do not care. I have not been refunded for the air mattress and at no point did they offer a discount or assistance in assembly, considering it will be me paying to live in a house with no furniture. At no point was it communicated to me that there were stock issues. How is this fair and how can IKEA get off with no culpability in this? Judging from their Trustpilot score, I seem to think that I am not the only person with these issues, and I also think that they genuinely do not care given their size. I wish to escalate this, but customer services keep passing me on to another agent who tells me the same thing.",Trustpilot_USA
"Ikea Perth/WA . Ikea Perth/WA
Used to be better but recently hard to buy items either in store or on line. We started with 6 fixed wardrobes, glass front, slide doors, shelves, racks, about 60 items altogether. Main boxes were not in stock at the time we were in store, supposed to be next day, then weren't, we spent 2 weeks trying every day on line, always something was missing, wrong information about availability, then we reduced order to whatever was at the time, we moved forward to payment and couldn't pay, as some items were not available even though were in stock a few minutes before when browsing. Then we removed almost 50% of order, bought whatever we could, paid on line with delivery, next day had a call that some items are still missing, we cancelled it and requested refund, got it confirmed then same day courier rang that is making order and some stuff is missing, we told him it's cancelled, he was surprised (???). We are trying to buy at least the big parts for those wardrobes for more than a month now, hoping to collect small things over time, it's not far, but again, things available becoming unavailable when it comes to payment and availability information stating around 8 weeks, which might be wrong later anyway. Customer service is super helpless over phone and email, twice gave us most useless information ever like ""please try again another day"". We are slowly giving up idea of buying from IKEA, we had plan to buy kitchen after that, but having this experience, are looking for other shops already, before we even started.

"Good for small purchases, appalling for anything requiring post service care . I ordered a mattress on finance within the Reading store and the man working took my details down incorrectly meaning that when my first payment was due, the payment declined thus affecting my credit score (about to arrange a mortgage so sounds a lot worse than it is).

Called Ikano to amend payment details and they then took the details down incorrectly AGAIN!! thus another strike on the credit rating.

Made a complaint to them but they basically couldn't care less and blamed IKEA (even though the second time was their fault). Called the customer service line and whilst they sympathised, they told me that I had to go into the store and lodge a complaint there.

Myself and then my partner have been back twice so far and have not heard anything back from IKEA at all.

I am in the process of complaining to the financial ombudsman but unlikely that I can have these impacts on my credit rating removed without IKEA helping out. They are not prepared to do this.

Whilst IKEA are a good company to use for small bits and pieces around the house, if you require anything that requires post sales service, they are not for you. I will now be, and have been since, using John Lewis for any larger purchases as this would not happen on their watch. They actually care about your experience and I fear this could have been resolved in a more timely manner without so much time and effort from me.

I continue to wait on hold listening to their recorded message about how easy it is to use their on-line system over and over again and how quickly they will respond shortly.

We got an e-mail confirming the time was 11-3 on Thursday (a week day off work). No delivery!! We call and they tell us sorry but some of items were out of stock after all and they would not be coming!! Nothing they can do!!!

So we re-arrange again this time for Sunday, promised 11-3. We get another e-mail and text comfirming delivery, we call and change assembly team too. Again it doesn't come!! We call and are told, oh sorry some of your items are a months wait now or discontinued so thats why they didn't turn up!! We asked why we were not informed about this and they just said sorry!! We cancel the items which are my childrens beds and who are already sleeping on mattresses in their rooms and my little girls chest of drawers! and ask for the rest to be delivered!! We are given another date and again re-arrange delivery and assembly who knows if it will come or not!!!!

They literally don't call, or knock, or buzz. They just get a picture of your apartment number, and that's all they need to prove they tried.

"The delivery service in a IKEA Dublin is a disgrace . The delivery service in a IKEA Dublin is a disgrace. In IKEA Dublin shop, we have been told delivery is accommodating and the person we were speaking with put a note on our delivery for the hub/driver to deliver our products between 10am and 1pm on Monday 23 as it would have been hard to be home from 3pm to 5pm. The driver called us at 3:03pm saying that he could be to our place in 30 minutes. We told him it was too late now and the driver told us he could do the delivery tomorrow morning. The day after, I took the day off from work to wait for the delivery and nothing. We then called the customer service to ask them when they were going to deliver. We first spoke to someone who contacted the Hub and told us it wasn't possible and, all of the sudden the phone hangs up! I We called again and continue the conversation with someone else. This time we learnt we were not scheduled for delivery and that we had to re-book, that the delivery was not going to happen today and neither tomorrow! We were not happy with this, but asked to be delivered on next Tuesday because we are away, and we have been told there is a 4 days turn around for deliveries and that it can only be on Saturdays, Sundays and Mondays. We have been forced to ask a friend to get the delivery on Sunday for us and now our friend has to wait from 7am to 7pm to wait for the delivery. Even if drivers call an hour before the delivery, which is never true since they typically call 15mins to 30mins before they arrive, it is totally unacceptable to give no proper notice of delivery and force customers to stay home all day, while waiting for the call! There is a zero lack of flexibility and communication, they keep you waiting for as long as possible when trying to solve the issue by phone. So we got our friend to render herself available to Ikea delivery on a Sunday from 7am to 7pm, and now we even have to move everything from our friends place to ours (useless to have it delivery on the first place).

"Terrible company. . Terrible company.

April 2nd, I ordered a desk to be delivered. They don't deliver very often, so I picked April 16th as my delivery date.

On April 12th, I received an email saying my delivery date was the 16th with a 12 hour window.

I worked from home on the 16th, just so I could be here for the delivery.

The entire day passed, no sign of Ikea.

I called Ikea support to see where my delivery was.

I was intially on hold for 15 mins. The person who finally answered said the delivery date is only a suggested date. The delivery could actually take anything from 2 to 4 weeks.

I ask to cancel my order. When I ordered, nothing was mentioned about this potentially taking a month to deliver a very basic computer table. I was told it would be delivered today.

She puts me on hold. I am then on hold for 90 minutes. That's not a typo. They put you on hold for 90 minutes when you tell them you want to cancel an order.

When the next person finally answers, I tell her I want to cancel. She says she'll cancel it, but I won't get the delivery fee refunded, even though nothing has been delivered.

I tell her that's unacceptable I want a full refund. We go back and forth e a few times, she basically tells me ""too bad"", and then puts me on hold again.

I've now been on hold for another 30 minutes when she gets back on the line and gives me a reference number. They are not going to voluntarily refund the delivery fee. I will have to see what the refund is then dispute the charge.

In today's world, service like this is a disgrace.

There are plenty of places to buy furniture from. Find a reputable company and avoid this company at all costs. Order a desk from Amazon and get it delivered in two days or go to a local store and support your local business.

I will never again even consider buying from Ikea.

Updated on May 22, 2018:

I received word from my credit card company. I had filed a dispute with my credit card about the charge and my credit card has given me a full refund, including the delivery fee that Ikea didn't want to refund.

"""I have a dream"".. that one day Ikea will deliver my order . My first oder from Ikea online ""Take a chance on me""... after they had taken my ""Money Money Money"" just didn't turn up despite the 'Great News' texts from Ikea. Not good, so ""S.O.S"" I called customer services who asked if i'd like the delivery rescheduled for Saturday morning, I said ""I Do, I DO, I Do, I Do, I Do"". They also refunded my £35 delivery charge.

Friday, ""The Day Before You Came"", more 'Good new texts' from Ikea. Saturday morning and with time ""Slipping through my fingers"" no delivery. So I call customer services and speak to Francesca who put me through to a delivery team after 20 mins of ""Ring Ring"" and that on-hold music ""Thank you for the Music""...NOT...who had no clue who I was and could not help. poor job Francesca, ""Does your Mother know?"".
So I called again... ""That's the name of the game"" it seems.
Spoke to someone who told me my order was never despatched ""When all is said and done"". I asked for a supervisor to call me, she promised me she would... nothing.
Then Sunday, a supervisor calls and tells me the refund of the £35 delivery charge was a good will payment.. Really !!... a refund of an expensive service that they failed to deliver is a good will !!. He also promised and promised again it would be delivered on Tuesday
So Tuesday... nothing. So I call again and I speak with Alex, a supervisor who says my account is in 'Read only' and offers me £60, as Ikea offer a £30 per day compensation for a failed delivery. So shouldn't that be £90?. I asked to speak to a 'Team Leader', but will have to wait for them call me as per Ikea policy apparently.

1430 - “You’re the next delivery”

1535 - Your Order hasn’t been loaded on the truck, earliest delivery is now Thursday”

So - I’m in an empty house with no wardrobes, coffee tables, desk which I need to work at, Sofa to sit on, Lamps etc. Ikea expect me to take a day off work to facilitate their incompetence. Total compensation offered - £30. Even more insulting when my total spend this weekend (delivery order plus in store purchases) is over £3500. I’ve wasted a whole day waiting when I could have been more productive, had IKEA the integrity to tell me the initial problem in the first place.

"Kitchen Installed Against Regulations . Kitchen Installed Against Regulations

I planned my kitchen with Ikea, took the plans back to them multiple times to review to ensure something like this did not happen. It's not until we tried to get a new cooker (which was an amazing deal which we have now lost out on) a few months after the kitchen was installed we found out that the extractor hood above it was installed far too close to our existing oven be legally safe. The oven was on the plans. The extractor itself (and the entire kitchen) was installed by Ikea fitters and in the instructions for the extractor it specifies a minimum distance it needs to be from the cooker/hob, and was installed in our kitchen 11cm too short of this distance. Because this was installed into a cupboard (also installed by the fitter, also on the plans reviewed by Ikea), we now have to get a new cupboard at additional cost to ourselves, and fit it again.
This is not something I expect to happen when I ask the kitchen department to review the plans and make sure the kitchen is safe & acceptable.
This is not something I expect to happen when paying for an entire kitchen.
This is not something I expect to happen when I pay again for professional fitting (which had several other additional problems in itself; fitters turning up late, leaving early, finishing the job a day late, shoddy workmanship which was have had to cover up)

"Darwin was not right . Take popcorn and sit, below my history:

1) Bought a kitchen in december
2) Kitchen delivered late with missing part
3)multiple mail and phone call to service number (each call waitnin min 1 hour)
4) At the end I was asked to go to the shop because they could not do anything
5) Went to shop (1 hour driving / 1 hour waiting / 5 min speaking / 1 hour driving back) . Finally Ikea employee acknowledge that a part was missing and promised to send it
6) 2 weeks without and news
7) other calls
8) finally part was shipped

Unfortunately I still needed a working desk for the kitchen so I had to go to Ikea

1) Asked Ikea to plan a working desk according to the kitchen project done by Ikea itself (present in theirs archive)
2) The employee probably unable to read numbers bigger than 200 projected a working desk (U shape) with one side 10 cm longer t and another one 20 cm longer than the project
3) Received wrongly projected working desk
4) 10 phone calls (each one waiting 1 hour ) and same number of email
5) Finally the solution: ""Ehm...... could you go to the shop?"" - ""Sure, I spend my day, normally waiting to go to the Ikea shot to explain the workers what they should do!!!'
6) Went to shop, explained the situation to an employee (This time I had acknowledged some embrional level of understanding"" ) said: ""Oh gosh, you are right, this is our mistake!!! I mean we planned a working desk based on OUR kitchen project and we mistaked bi 30 cms!!!"" Trying to show some understanding to the clearly difficult situation in wich such comapny must find itself just said "" Well, you know, maybe it was also my mistake, I should have checked the work of your colleague...."" Answer: 'Absolutely not! it was our mistake and in 6 weeks we will fix it!"" Tired but happy, I went home
7) After 2 weeks without any information I tried to call the mitical authomatic number, also here 8 calls and 12 emails
8) After being replied another time to go to the shop (because in reality I leave there, on a mounted bed) finally somebody that must be considered, according to local standard, some kind of nobel prize answered:

""Sorry but we cannot do anything, it is your measures, not ours""

With laughing tears I answered to the local evolutionary missing ring that 1) The measures were their measure because the project was their project 2) that we had already had the same conversation including a pilgrimage from my side to Ikea shops and we had already agreed to change the working desk.

Those two concepts together clearly need time to be elaborated so I am still waiting for an answer.....

"Never Shows up to Collect Recalled Items for many times . I am so disappointed at Ikea after being their customer for many years. I have scheduled THREE pick-ups for the dresser that they recalled for the kid-deaths. However, they didn't show up for any scheduled pick-ups. There are always reasons that stopped them from coming, such as no confirmation, no answer, truck broken-down, etc... Stupid reasons.. The customer service offered no help and simply told me that they didn't know what happened. They neither tried to help nor understood my time being wasted. All they do is to keep making new pick-up schedules for me and not able to tell me what time the pick-up trunk is coming. Excuse me! They thinkI just have all the time in the world in this holiday season sitting in my apartment for a whole day waiting for some trucks that would never ever show up, huh? In conclusion, this gives me so many disappoints from this company. Yes, their furniture is cheap, but it does not mean they can treat their customers like the penniless.",Trustpilot_USA

I spoke to the manager and he said they offer no compensation or refund of delivery.
I said to him i definitely gave you the correct address , please listen to the recording.

Was on hold for 48 minutes whilst he was doing this!

ZAC from PETERBROUGH call centre then apologized and said i was correct.
SIMON from SHEFFIELD call centre was responsible for not putting the correct address through.
Also store says opens at 9am but long queue stand outside for 10 minutes before they let us in. This was on 23rd Dec 17

Useless and incompetent employees work in customer services and they promise to call you back but they never do, probably because they p*ss themselves when they deal with angry and fed up customers.

"Their excuses should go in a book for the worlds worst excuses in history . If I could give this company zero stars I would,what an utter disgrace, ordered our last kitchen unit 2 weeks in advance to come on 15th December, in time to finish the kitchen for christmas. Paid for the delivery. It didn’t come, I’ve heard 4 different excuses. One being their delivery drivers were given 2 days off because of snow. Considering they got parcel force to deliver and it wasn’t that bad in Peterbrough that excuse doesn’t cut with me. Their other excuse was that parcel force where 4/5 days behind in their deliveries and that parcel force would not deliver on a weekend. Very strange when we phoned up parcel force and got them to deliver part of the parcel on the Sunday and they hadn’t even phoned them at all. They offered us £30 gift voucher for their store which considering my husband has took days off work to complete the kitchen, we’ve phoned up everywhere trying to chase our missing parts is a total insult and after the way we’ve been treat do they seriously think I’d ever want to shop in their store again!!! I explained to the company my children ranging from 18 to 27 had lost their dad in August and I had invited them to mine for Christmas dinner to try and make it as nice as possible under the circumstances yet they have told me they cant deliver it now until the 30th December. We even offered to drive 350 miles to get the unit ourselves and were told we wouldn’t be allowed through the security gate. We told them to bring it to the gate and we would wait outside they still wouldn’t allow us to go collect. We asked for managers to contact us and they don’t have any aparently, contacted them on Facebook and they answered a few messages and then stopped replying.

"Come on Ikea - get your post-sales customer service act together!! . Shame that delightful in-store kitchen department staff are so badly let down by a shocking level of customer service from the post-sales delivery team. 4 stars have slipped here - and if I could I would drop the last one too.

I have always had a firm view of Ikea as being a trusted name - but this has now been totally reversed by a rubbish customer service. From the new kitchen that I had delivered just one drawer panel was faulty and had to be replaced. Ikea couldn't order a proverbial **** up in a brewery - twice now I have been promised a date and received the usual text etc beforehand - stayed in and arranged my day so that I could sign for the goods - then been disappointed when twice they didn't turn up. Builders booked both times so have incurred cost there too.

Hopefully third time lucky for delivery a few days before Christmas but too late for it to be installed. Keeping fingers crossed that they do in fact deliver when they say they will. Otherwise I will have to find a way to remove that final star.

"What next? . Firstly, IKEA reminds me of the long, horribly slow moving queues in the USSR, where communism meant scarcity for everyone equally unless you were a privileged elite... When you want to eat/drink at IKEA, you have to queue at their cafeteria, which can be such a long wait in the end you give up. If you don't give up and manage to get a tray of food and drink, which i must say is reasonable priced/cheap, after you are done eating/drinking you must not only take tray back but also ''help them recycle' - they have 4-5 bins where you must put your leftovers and rubbish in, then place tray with plates, cups etc on conveyor belt to go in for wash. Queue for that too. Fair enough, the food is cheap but the products are not as cheap. Now i am wondering if they will ask their customers to also wash the plates after they are done? We shall see. In any case, i like their products but just be wary of what you buy and why.",Trustpilot_USA

"Ikea sell the worst quality alongside good quality. . I am writing as I am so perplexed at the dichotomy that is my experience with Ikea.
I have a utility room into which I put almost €800 worth of Ikea shelves.
The Kallas shelves which I bought were superb. Fittings were exact and tolerances of unit parts strengthened those parts.
However, the Tjana file boxes were of a such an extremely low quality cardboard, they looked like a joke. I demand a refund.
The Drona cloth shelf boxes were attractive and functional while the Branas whicker baskets were so weak and ill fitting they are not fit for purpose. I demanded a refund.
The Ballymun store experience is great while the website is so dated its ridiculous. Janis and Ciaran were especially good in the store as were the checkout staff. There is not even a purchasing page on the website.
In other words, on one hand well done, on the other hand shame on Ikea.

I demanded a refund which they haggled with me as long as they could, again waiting on hold many times for over an hour. Finally gave up the fight with a 20% refund.

Bought a corner sofa , when it arrived half of it was brown (suppose to be dark grey) and the brown half was 100% a reject or refunded as it was covered it layers of dirty old fluff and looked as if an animal was sleeping on it. Then complained and said they would send a brand new sofa ( one that was ONE sofa and ALL one colour as we ordered) waited 5 weeks again for them to get this NEW sofa delivered it was the long weekend so we had to cancel our weekend away as we thought the arrival of the sofa we had been waiting patiently on was more important, then no one showed. Which is not surprising as half of the comments on here explain the lack of decency that Ikea show to its loyal customers! Then went in and complained after cancelling our holiday for absolutely no reason!!!!!! Then they told us they had lied the whole time and the sofa was completely out of production meaning there was no 'new one' which was suppose to arrive . They said they will have to refund us the money for the sofa after wasting 2 and a half months altogether , kept waiting and waiting and no hope! I cannot express how utterly disgraceful Ikea is, for such a big company all they care about is money and could not give a feck about customer service.

your website has been designed by people who have no idea whatsoever on how to design websites. get rid of them and find people who can!!!
first of all although i live in the UK i also have a property if Cuglieri Sardinia Italy. I had delivered this week a Sofa bed which is not perfect but acceptable. meanwhile i wish to purchase a wardrobe so i have tried to use your extremely difficult, non intuitive and frankly rubbish piece of design software. It stinks! four times now i have tried to use it and it does not automatically save the item i am looking at, it is not intuitive so that when i try to set the deign height to 2010mm height i an just as likely to find I end up with 2036 height! Sh it! back out again and have another go. now thoroughly peed off and have given up. trouble is there is no store in Sardinia even though the Island is as large as England. No matter I thought i would try the UK setup but, although i am an Ikea ""family"" member your badly designed system tells me I am not registered. YES I AM!!, if i try and sign in on the Italian site it transfers me to the Netherlands and tells me i am not registered on this site. I keep going round in circles. I actually have purchased a 10 room house in Cuglieri and after some building works intend to install three bathrooms, two kitchens, outfit four large bedrooms and a large living room and i was intending to use yourselves (Italy) branch but you and your company make it too difficult.

"Damaged Items, Refused Refund, Wasted Our Time - DO NOT USE IKEA . We ordered a 65 pound bookcase from Ikea which was delivered on Sunday 15th October x2 panels were damaged with huge dents and scratched (careless delivery drivers who have no respect!!). We complained and it was arranged that the x2 panels would be collected and replaced today - Wednesday 18th October. My Husband had to take the day off work to wait in all day for the delivery men (My Husband is self employed so we lost a days wage) We have now discovered that one of the panel's for the bookcaseare is damaged..... AGAIN! Feeling extremely fed up and annoyed I phoned Ikea Croydon to ask for a full refund. We are told that the bookcase will need collecting, I explain my Husband has partially assembled it and taking it apart would cause damage. The woman then tells us we would not be entitled to a full refund!! They offered to replace the panels again but I refuse to waste anymore of our time and money on such cheap rubbish delivered by morons who are clumsy and careless. Ikea have completely wasted our time and caused a massive inconvenience to us not once.. but twice!

i asked they do you trust independent technician maybe i am independent technician with big company as example. he said nothing it means this all cheating .( Manager )

"Ikea Thurrock Lakeside Essex . (In my own personal opinion or perception) the place is an absolute dump.
*The staff non existent customer service I've never come across a set of rude, blasé' nonchalant assistants than this place. I used to have to go to Wembley which was the nearest store, when this place opened the staff were all nicey, nicey now they dont give two hoots. Their only concern is surrounding you at the tills to make sure you pay, with security that look like out of Camberwick green (I'm so scared). if I wanted to nick your goods I would go around the other way and just walk out of the entrance.
*The food and the restaurants at 1720 hrs today the place looked like an earthquake, food everywhere staff milling around doing absolutely as little as possible. The Logan berry juice dispenser empty again ! I noticed the staff putting massive portions of fish on plates laughing and joking, then taking them out of the back kitchen doors. The food they served the customers slopped on the plate like food in the military out on exercise, (kids meal = 6 runner beans, 10 chips and a piece of fish that looked like 2 fish fingers stuck together £2). Absolute joke ! Dirt. muck and filth all over the restaurant seating area and 1 lady cleaning a central curved carousel table, over and over again. ""Obviously waiting for the night time cleaners to do most of the lackeying"" ?
* Management where are they ? I never see them and they certainly aren't about kicking backsides into work ? it's no wonder the place is so badly run. If this is the way they do things in Sweden which I know for a fact it surely cant be, then things have changed in the land of Volvo and Saab.

Ikea changed my delivery date twice to suit them as they did not have the goods which I had ordered and paid for in stock, The second change was made, at 7.30 in the evening the day before the delivery was due. When I phoned to say the day they wanted to delivery didn't suit I ended up talking to a rude young man who to say the least was unhelpful. I needed to know what time the new delivery would be and all he would tell me was between 7am and 7 pm I asked for a supervisor to call me, he assured me this would happen yet an hour later, no call, When I phoned again, he had hidden by order on the system, making it virtually impossible for the person I was speaking with to find my details,. When she eventually did, he had not changed the delivery day as requested, meaning that 37 packages would have been delivered to an empty house. Nor had he logged my requested for a call back I have tried to speak to someone in a senior position to make a complaint to but Ikea won't give any contact details. I have emailed them and no response. Their products are okay but unless you have no other option, I would avoid their delivery service.",Trustpilot_USA

I brought a dining table and four chairs from ikea and after a while one of the chair legs just gave way and I contacted the company who informed me that the chair was no longer under gaurantee and that they could not do anything to help me I then pointed out that the reason for the chair failure was poor workmanship as there was no glue in the joints and therefore it was ""not fit for purpose"" that is why the joint failed but ikea who don't really care is now going to hear from the retail ombudsmen regarding this as trading standards states that goods should be sold without defect and last for a reasonable time which did not happen in this case.",Trustpilot_USA

"IKEA doesn't care if young children fall from the stairs or get electrified . A while ago we ordered two Patrull stair gates and a small Patrull night lamp at IKEA. We ordered them on the website and got them delivered, since the IKEA store is very hard to reach for us.

We don't own a car and don't have driver licenses (purposely). To get to the IKEA store we have to walk to the railway station, to take the train, transfer to an other train, transfer to a minibus service and finally walk about 15 minutes in an industrial area. On my own it's already quite a journey. To get there with our small children (0 and just 3 years old) is nearly impossible. And when we would ever get there, we have to get back home too...

One of the advantages of getting the IKEA order delivered, is that you don't have to get back to the store, when something gets broken, but a repair service comes to your house.

Now appears that the stair gates and night lamp are disfunctional. They are unsafe:
- The stair gates can suddenly open, so children can fall from the stairs. Epic fail from IKEA!
- The cap of the night lamp can come off, so children can get electrified. Again: epic fail from IKEA!

IKEA called both products back, so costumers can get there money back. Apparently IKEA doesn't want to be the company that let toddlers fall from the stairs and put 220 volts through their little bodies after all.

However...

We have to take the unsafe stair gates and night lamp to the IKEA store to get our money back. I tried to explain several times that this would be impossible for us, but IKEA just replies with their standard answers.

""Sorry sir. We didn't provide for this. We're not going to provide anything for this. You can also take in the products later. Even a year later.""

In a year we still don't have a car, so we still got stuck with the unsafe stair gates and night lamp.

Because IKEA behaved this irresponsible by bying or developing cheap 'child safe' products, we have a loss of about 100 euro. (Two stair gates, a night lamp and the delivery costs. When we order new, safe stair gates, we have to pay delivery costs again, so this is also a real loss.)

I offered IKEA to send them a picture or video, with me destroying the products, so they can give our money back. They said that wasn't there policy.

Without blinking there eyes IKEA takes 100 euro from a family with two young children for potentially lethal products, but they're not behaving responsible when they get caught selling this very dangerous rubbish.

So, is this the earning model of IKEA? Take your money and let your children die? Not cool! Not cool at all!

Update: of course, after banging the internet drums, IKEA did pick up the dangerous items and will hopefully give the money back.",Trustpilot_USA

"Stylish, good deals, decent quality . I've been a fan of IKEA for years for basics like shelving, drawer inserts, dishware, rugs, etc. I previously had an IKEA bed, but it was too basic for my taste and I now have a more decadent bed. But if you like a more simple or classic aesthetic, their beds are pretty good. I still have a mattress from them that I love! I was skeptical about getting an IKEA mattress at first, but my mom's friend had one and loved it, so I decided to test theirs in store. I found the prices to be amazing compared to other mattress retailers, and liked the firmness of the foam. Unrolling it was kinda fun too, because it poofs up and expands before your eyes!

Building the furniture used to be a pain, but I've actually gotten pretty fast at it now that I have an electric screwdriver (IKEA too). Plus, I have moved enough times that I can remember the building directions by heart. I find I have a small sense of pride after building the shelves or whatever. But I know for others that's an annoyance, so if you plan to get IKEA staff to build for you, make sure you evaluate the total cost when comparing other stores. For some items you may not be saving much, and their wood is closer to particle board quality, so you may be better off getting a sturdier piece for a bit more. I personally find the quality to be good enough for my shelves and whatnot, and didn't have a problem when I used to have an IKEA sofa and chair set. However, the bed I used to have did have slats that broke in several places, and the wood on the table I have scratches pretty easily.",Trustpilot_USA

Normally I would not write about IKEA, because everybody knows them anyhow, but after this recent experience I really have to say that they positivly surprised us and exceeded our expectations:

Regardless what furniture we were looking for, we found it at IKEA. The quality of the cabinets was clearly better than expected. F.e. the surface coating is much better, thicker and more robust than with other producers in the same price category.

But the best was really the aftersales service: regardless what issue I had, it was immediately corrected, swift and with no questions. In one case a package had been damaged, in another case something missing. A phone call was enough and a few days later we got the spare parts, even in one case 2 years after.",Trustpilot_USA
"Joseph McDowald . I'll leave the short version.. We bought a couch for $700!! Got it delivered the next day (an additional $70 fee)...then spent 3 hours in the delivery line to top it all off.

Got it delivered, at 11am next day Opened the box and found a few screws missing.

Went back up there and it 2 hours for the customer service rep to give us a new bag of screws.

Got home opened the bag and they were THE WRONG SCREWS!!! I spent about 45 minutes comparing the screw to see if there was an error, NO WRONG BAG, WRONG SCREWS.

By now it's about 3:30 pm, our whole afternoon is almost over.

Feeling very irritated we went back up there again!!!

THIS IS WHERE THEY CROSSED THE LINE!! After a brief conversation the customer service rep brought out ADRIEN in Recovery Clearance.

This guy was so rude to me, my mother and girlfriend, accusing us of not knowing what we were talking about and out right telling us we were lying.

We told ADRIEN several time that the screws we were given the Second time at IKEA was the wrong size but ADRIEN refused to listen. He continued his aggressive rant leaning over, over-talking my mother and girlfriend and telling them they were all wrong!!

Kind of upset I kept my composure to explain to ADRIEN that I personally spent 45 minutes assembling the furniture and he must have made a mistake. Even still his aggressive demeanor and assertive over-talking watered out my obvious complaint.

Still we waited and after another 2 hours we finally got the 2 SCREWS we were waiting for.

The customer service rep and ADRIEN grouped together to inspect the screws, with ADRIEN bellowing under his breath. ( there were 2 different sized screws by the way)

Upon leaving I asked the customer service rep to speak to ADRIEN I felt my mother and girlfriend deserved an apology for how he talked to them.

I wanted to see if he was a man of integrity, could admit his wrongs and forgive my family for the disrespect.

He claimed he couldn't come out for whatever reason after spending the last 30 minutes arguing with us.

If he would have came out and apologized I would not have left this review but...

"Indescribably awful home delivery service. . My pregnant wife and I were in IKEA yesterday, 31-03-2015. There, we were told that we couldn't get some of our products right away, even though they were on stock, because they were at the top of the warehouse and had to be picked up after closing hours.

We were instead offered to pay for our order and have it delivered to us the next day, for 600DKK extra (200 for ""plucking,"" 400 for delivery). We paid the order in full and were promised it would be delivered between 15 and 19 today, 01-04-2015.

We have waited the whole day without anyone arriving or calling. At 19:30, past the delivery deadline, I have contacted IKEA chat. There, I was told my order was unfortunately somehow ""lost"" in the system and erased. Instead, I was told that I should expect my order on Saturday. I said I found that unacceptable, since i have waited for the order and was not going to be available on Saturday. Then I got a call from the transport company, saying they would arrive today after all.

They have arrived at 20:30. The order they delivered was 90% wrong. Most of the items on my list were missing, and many items I didn't order were included. They took the order back, and I insisted they give me a contact number for someone who could solve my issue. Upon calling that number, I was told I should instead call IKEA kundeservice, which is not closed. They will be closed for the following 2 days. This means that my wife and I won't get the chance to use our two days off to prepare the baby's nursery, like we planned.

In conclusion: Delayed delivery, ZERO communication until I myself took the initiative, wrong order. Order at your own risk.

EDIT 05-04-2015: Yesterday (Saturday), I still haven't received any contact from IKEA. I called them instead. We agreed that they would deliver after 19:00. I re-asked twice whether I can be assured that my full order will be delivered. They twice guaranteed that it will.

Since then, and up until now (Sunday morning), I have not heard a word from them, via phone or email, and nobody has delivered my order, even though I have waited at home since 19:00.

"You can not complain about Ikea's service. There is no....! . I bought 6 pieces in Bangkok in beginning of august 2014, as well as several other items. It is the chairs it is about. The two loose legs on the chair was packed wrong. The paint was not properly dry before being packed and they were just packed closely together without paper between. The result is to destroy some of the paint.

One of the chairs was completely deformed, so we had to spend a few hours driving back to Ikea over in Bang Na. The problem with the wrong package, they knew well ...!? [COARSE LANGUAGE REMOVED] ? The chairs were assembled, so that was my problem now.

After they found a chief who had the necessary permission to undertake a replacement of the chair (half hour), we could then drive home again.

I have asked Ikea the following questions: Was it a good idea to equip the factory in China with quality control? Should they have a quality, then they should perhaps consider using a different one, and not from blind Foundation.

Ikea didnt answer my letter.

When you have a product that has a known bug with the paint, so I think you should consider to solve it, and not like now, where I have to figure out how to repair the two chairs that are damaged.

"Awful experiance with ikea.co.uk . As we had just moved into our new house we thought we would order a spare bed for our visitors due in 3 weeks time. So we placed a order and within a week our delivery arrived.....

1ST CALL. Waited for 45 minutes for a response.

Having received our delivery for a bed from Ikea we noticed there was no bed slats included on the order notes or in the delivery. After phoning Ikea we spoke to Sarah, who informed us that the reason for this is because we didn't include them in order. This was not the case as it was included in the price of the bed and it was a fault with their order management software. Delivery is to be rearranged on Saturday.

Waited on Saturday until 1 pm after no indication of delivery confirmation of the dispatch of ETA of arrival.

2nd call. Waited 45 mins for a response.

Spoke to a unknown Rep, who had no information about our case as the previous rep had not included enough detail in their CRM/Case management software (poor show Ikea). Rep said he needed to make another call and would keep me on hold for a few mins. After waiting 45 minutes the automated system dropped the call....

3rd call. 45 minutes on hold.

Spoke to Richard, who was useful however he informed me that he was due to finish his shift in 30 minutes and would forward our case into a responsible person who he confirmed would take ownership of our issue and call us back with a follow up on the status of our order.

3rd call - 5pm Saturday 45 mins waiting for a response.

Spoke to Shane, who very honestly admitted it doesn't look like its coming today. Which resulted in our house guests sleeping on the floor.......Shane processed our order for some new bed slats and rearranges a 3rd delivery slot for us. despise us informing him that we cannot simply book a day off work at the drop of the hat to receive these orders he books us in a slot for this Monday 9-4 pm. No use to us what so ever... Shane then put a request in for a £30 voucher for our troubles not enough in my opinion.

The 3rd time it was my GF, and since I was sleeping like a babe and never even woke up to notice her cursing and moving to the sofa, I can't really complain about that one ;)

Anyway. Turns out the slatted bed base wasn't broken, but simply shifted between the sides and fell down through the opening. Since the bed had been incresingly squeekish ever since I moved from my old apartment I decided to check the screws to see if they were still alright... Imagine my suprise when I found that half of the screws were not there! Suddenly I felt very lucky that I hadn't completely ruined the bed in the last months (moral of the story... If your little brother says ""Go take care of the dishwasher...I'll set up the bed by myself, no problem!"" Make sure he doesn't discard half the screws and uses tie-wraps instead because he finds it quicker...)

After checking my supplies I found a breadbag with most of the screws and several other missing parts I never even knew existed, but in the end I still came up short on a few of those long typical IKEA screws... Since the bed was over 10 years old and was no longer sold by Ikea, I feared I was screwed (yes... pun intended. Shame on me) But I decided to contact them anyway to see if I could buy them somehow. I was very glad that all they needed was the amount of screws I needed and the screw id-number, - I found this in a manual online- and they would send it to me free of charge.

Five days later I received the screws in a giftbag with a complete Customs Declaration. Origin; Sweden. With them I was able to fix my bed, and what do you know... It hasn't squeeked once since. Nice service!",Trustpilot_USA

As many people probably know IKEA has recently decided to annoy the customers by discontinuing some lines in the middle of the life of their catalogue, so I had difficulty of buying some doors for my cabinet frames. Mick not only arranged the order for me from start to finish but gave me a discount.How is that for service? Wait,that's not all.He arranged for some fabric samples to be sent to me as my local store does not sell them (why?) and so saved me a long track all across London for a few swatches. If everybody were like him at IKEA...",Trustpilot_USA
"'Talk the talk but don't walk the walk!' . I ordered a wardrobe a few weeks ago. After spending three hours putting it up, I found that the last piece (the door) didn't have the holes for the hinges. Not a massive problem but I'd like to have a door for my wardrobe.

Called after sales and spoke to a lovely girl who was sorting everything out for me, or so I thought. She said I would receive a replacement part within 3-5 working days. Great.

After 4 days, I heard nothing despite being told I would get a text. So I called and spoke to a nice guy who advised that the part was with DPD and that he would get some tracking details for me. This never happened.

My mum has called today to then be told that the part hasn't even been dispatched yet! After being told this I was livid so decided to call up myself. This time, the person who answered the phone sounded like he couldn't care less. I got a 'what ever' after almost everything I said. He then said he would get me the tracking details, the same as the two previous people.

Looks like I'll just have to wait and hope that there is at least one competent person at the company who can fulfil my request and not constantly lie to me!

Most definitely will not be ordering again.",Trustpilot_USA
"I felt like being cheat with no after sales service . I live about 15 miles from Ikea Croydon. Just order the bed frame and other stuffs to be delivered two days ago, realized that the bed frame doesn't included the instruction/installation menu. I called csutomer service but alway keep me on hold and rather impossible to reach them at all. In one of the call, I have been waiting for more than 45 minutes on the phone listening to those music they play on the phone. I believe non of any company let you hold till that long. Seems I have to work from Monday to Friday, with no other choices, my partner over 60th have to help me to go the Ikea Croydon by train and ask for the instruction. Again, the next day after compare and instruction menu so many tools was missing from the packaging and some of the woods look used with some old screw inside. Again, couldn't reach them by phone, I have no choice but have to take a day off and go the Ikea again just because of the missing part and discrepancies of the products. Never never purchase from them anymore if you wish to have good after sales service. Small items should be fine as you can easily see them from the packaging but not the big stuffs.",Trustpilot_USA
"Disgraceful Delivery Service . Sorry for the long review, but I'm quite annoyed and feel the full story is the best way to illustrate Ikea's incompetence.

Firstly I'd like to say the customer service staff are very friendly and helpful - I had no problem with them. The only issue there is the long call wait times, generally 10-15min minimum.

The major problems came in with the delivery service. From the start, this was an absolute shambles. They initially gave me a provisional delivery date two weeks in the future, which was an annoyance but not unacceptable. A week later, however, I received a text message saying that they'd pushed back the delivery a week further, without any explanation for the significant delay. I decided to suck it up and just wait.

In terms of delivery restrictions, I live in a town centre directly on a bus lane, so I informed Ikea that they wouldn't be able to park on the road and that they would need to pull up onto a drive next to the building. They sent a full-size lorry into the town centre, which wouldn't fit onto any drive I've ever seen, and barely fit up the road itself. Obviously, the delivery didn't go ahead, as the lorry drove on. I then had to wait an hour before I got a phone call from them to explain that they would have to redeliver another time on a smaller van, and that I would get a phonecall confirming this.

This phonecall took 4 days to appear, at which point they confirmed a new delivery date (now 4 weeks from the original order date). Deciding to make absolutely sure this delivery would go through, I rang in again to confirm the delivery restrictions. The delivery service hadn't put that a smaller van was needed on the system, so I explicitly stated this to the call handler and it was put onto the system, otherwise I would have had a lorry come again.

Roll on yesterday's delivery. I was given a delivery window by text of 6am-9am, which was a pain, but I was desperate to get the items delivered at all cost, so I left my phone on all night and waited for them to call. When I'd heard nothing by 9:30 the next day, I phoned customer services who were incredulous that I'd been given this delivery window as they can't deliver before 7am. On the system I was down for delivery between 1pm-5pm, and I'd get a call an hour in advance of delivery.

Fine, I thought; I can go out and do other things as long as I'm back by 1pm. Wrong. I received a call at midday saying 'we'll be there in 5 minutes'. Being half an hour away, this wasn't ideal. Luckily I managed to convince them to wait for me to get there. When I was half-way there, though, I got another call. 'I don't think we're going to be able to deliver today as the van's too big and there's nowhere to park nearby.' Being already half-way back, I wasn't accepting this and convinced the driver to wait nearby. When I got there, I could see that the van would fit into the drive next to the building and told him to circle back round and park on the drive.

Unfortunately, the ordeal didn't end there. As they unloaded the packages i could see they were numbered out of 9, but only 5 came out. Fully 4 of the 9 packages were missing. The drivers phoned up the warehouse and told me I'd get a phonecall once the warehouse staff had looked for these. I received no call yesterday, and now to today.

I decided to phone up today to chase this, and according to customer services there was nothing on the system - the drivers had listed the order as complete. Possibly as revenge for getting them to do their job and deliver my items, possibly just further incompetence from Ikea. Luckily the call handler was helpful, and set up a search for the items and gave me a case number, but it's going to be at least 48 hours before I hear anything.

So that's where I am now - one month after ordering, one fully failed delivery, one partially failed delivery (that would have fully failed without a lot of persuasion) and no idea when this will be resolved. I'm not looking forward to the next delivery, and I would recommend anyone considering purchasing items from Ikea to rent a van and pick it up themselves!",Trustpilot_USA

"They Didn't Refund Me For Something They Broke! . I bought a lot of furniture from Ikea in one move and it was kind of a nightmare. They delivered the wrong couch then took an entire week to pick up the wrong one and switch it out for the right one. Worst of all, they smashed an expensive mirror I had ordered en route, then failed to re-deliver a non-broken one. When I called and requested a refund, I got nothing. Who does that?!",Trustpilot_USA
"Better shop in store than online! . I ordered a chest of drawers from IKEA online for delivery. They sent me an email explaining I am to wait for a followup email on when it will be delivered. 2 days later i received the email. No options for delivery dates/times (like online food shopping does). So, the day THEY chose was not good for me and i needed to change.

I spent 2 weeks trying to contact IKEA and wasted so much phone credit! On my way home from work I had a missed call received 2 hours earlier, 'We're outside your house, with your delivery.'
I was livid. Re-called then and there and they said they are an external delivery service, so for a redelivery it will be charged.

Only good thing about the experience was I did receive my refund AND my phone credit once I gave proof. Just, will not be ordering for delivery in the future.",Trustpilot_USA
"Ridiculous waste of time! . Very poor customer service who does nothing to help you. Defunct delivery system. Poor communication.

"Online shopping convenient if limited, pricey delivery though . Ikea, where everyone feels conflicted. Happy to be able to get the light I wanted, for about what travelling to Ikea would cost me and with much less stress. I'm very glad that Ikea have introduced online shopping. However, nine pounds delivery for an eighteen-pound light is a bit steep, and the two other things that I might have purchased to make the delivery charge seem fairer weren't available for online purchase (why??). Ok experience, better to have done it than not to have done it.",Trustpilot_USA
"Never, ever order online from them . Crap. Don't answer the phone and just keep you on hold. Don't reply to emails. All I'm trying to do is cancel an order due to extortionate shipping prices that aren't made very clear before payment. Absolute crap. Livid",Trustpilot_USA
"Waiting for deliveries to arrive - still waiting . This has got to be the worst service I have ever received!

Started by looking for items online and whilst considering the purchase a determining factor was delivery time. Online estimate was for the 8th of November which was fine. After I bought the product I was told the delivery wouldn't be until the 15th of November, which almost doubled the time I had to wait! I found that not only annoying but also slightly dishonest.

I waited in on the 15th all day and effectively lost a day's worth of work, but thats ok if the items then get delivered. But, they didn't. When the delivery slot had 'expired' I attempted to call Ikea but the phone-line was engaged - I waited in excess of 35 mins in a queue and gave up!

My Wife attempted to call again later - still in a queue for the best part of an hour, just to be told that the driver attempted to deliver my goods but there was nobody in! Now that I find insulting - he has obviously not been at the right address or he is lying. She asked for an immediate re-delivery but that could not be facilitated and I would have to take another day off work the following week. She asked for a refund of the delivery cost, which also couldn't be accomedated until delivery had taken place and the driver had been interviewed. So, she cancelled the order.

I have still lost a day off work and have to find alternative place to purchase furniture. Its is poor service!

"Absolutely awful . This is the shortened version with some of the shortfalls left out to slim this down!

We bought a bed frame and mattress in August this year, as one of the things that reassured us was the 90 day pledge to exchange the mattress if we didn't like it. We were promised delivery the next day, but on the day of delivery we had to call them after 5pm as nothing had arrived. We were told that nothing at all had been scheduled and, bearing in mind our old bed was by then, at the rubbish tip non delivery was not an option and I made this clear to them and this was eventually sorted out but it wasn't a great start.

The real problems came when we decided that we needed to exchange the mattress as it just wasn't comfortable. The one we had tried was extremely comfy, but the one we endured for around a month was rock hard. The staff in the store, although polite, didn't seen to understand the 90 day exchange or know what to do. We spoke to three different people in the store and went away on the understanding that we would receive a phone call to schedule delivery of the new mattress, the old one would be picked up and as the new mattress was slightly cheaper, a refund would be processed.

The new mattress has arrived and the old one wasn't picked up and I have no refund. Every time I try to call there's a 30 - 45 minute wait to speak to someone, and all they can do is pass information on. The store won't get back to me and I have sent numerous emails to complain.

I have never experienced such a terrible system where you can't call or email the store directly, and the call centre can't help. The whole thing has been a joke from start to finish and I will never use them for anything again.",Trustpilot_USA

"Not bad.......... . Product wise IKEA are of course excellent.

I recently returned 2 products on 2 different occasions. Both purchased from their store - both returned within a week at the same store.

"Very good . I have to confess that just about all of my furniture is Ikea, so I have shopped there a lot. When I had a delivery of £1,200 worth of their furniture 6yrs ago, which was ordered online, it was a very pain free experience. I had a cupboard door, which was of a natural wood colour and whilst not faulty, had too much red in the it, making it look odd to the other 3 doors. Ikea swapped this without issue. The quality of their furniture is also good, 6 years on, everything is still as good as the day it arrived. I like building my own furniture, as I customise the items to fit against my high skirting boards, so they fit flush to the wall. Very pleased.",Trustpilot_USA
"Worst Customer Service Ever . Delivery lorry arrived, drivers had no idea which items were mine so I had to ferret around in the lorry finding my name on the boxes. Packaging was filthy, so had to open everything outside. Legs of chair were missing, cover of chair was ripped open and dirty. Rang customer services, they refused to courier the items out to me, and said I would have to wait 6 days for standard truck delivery of the items (these are small items, which would probably cost a tenner to send on a next day delivery. Ridiculous). I asked for some kind of refund of the delivery as I had taken a day off work to wait in for the items, we also have family coming to stay and this furniture was for their use. We will now have to quickly go out and buy the furniture elsewhere. Customer services refused any kind of refund of the delivery, and when I asked to speak to a manager they said 'they won't think any differently so there's no point'. The Ikea items will have to be returned, which will cost about £20 in petrol for a 2 hour round trip, plus the original £35 delivery charge, so I will have paid £55 for the pleasure of some dirty packaging and an unpaid day off work. Thanks Ikea, you really are as rubbish as everyone says.",Trustpilot_USA
"IKEA disses disabled . This review is for the store in Schaumburg, IL, USA. I am disabled and although I used to love to shop at Ikea, I am so sad that I cannot anymore because they do not have motorized shopping carts for disabled people. They have a bunch of manual wheelchairs that I cannot use, and that are always sitting there unused by anyone. Also, whenever I have asked an employee to assist me ... I cannot believe their rude responses. They just want me to go away and leave them alone to do their jobs, which obviously is not helping customers, and especially not disabled customers who are so darn needy. Ikea is non-disabled friendly in so many ways. Shame on them. I was going to try the one in Bolingbrook, but I see in someone else's review that they also do not have motorized shopping carts for disabled patrons. I asked an employee why they had no motorized carts for disabled shoppers and she said because the aisles are too narrow! LOL. Maybe they should use some of their own organization products.",Trustpilot_USA
"Home delivery . I used their home delivery service to get some furniture. I was unable to get time off work for the delivery slot they allocated me, so I rang them to change it. I was on hold for around 45 mins on an 0845 number to get it changed from Tuesday to Friday. I came home from work on the tuesday to find that delivery had been attempted. I was furious that I had spent money trying to get a delivery slot changed and they hadn't even done it properly. I was able to change it with the courier, luckily but sent a complaint to Ikea. A woman phoned me regarding my complaint and treated me as if I was stupid and I had gotten it wrong! When I explained I had recieved an email that confirmed the Friday delivery slot still no apology. Would not use again.",Trustpilot_USA
"Home Delivery Sucks . Ok, Ikea UK has decided not to acknowledge my complaint but it would be in everyone's best interest to know that their £35 home delivery charge is a total rip-off and a terrible experience!

Here is what I wrote to Ikea:
I have a very bad experience with delivery. My order number is 382960546 (bed, drawer, etc 6 items), order date online was 30/6/12. The original delivery date was 6/7/12. I had to take annual leave from work to receive the order. The truck arrived but the driver came without the right equipment to deliver the items. The driver was rude and mentioned that insufficient feedback when I have clearly instructed him to load at the loading bay. He was not interested and simply wanted to pass the job back to someone else. This is frustrating enough as I have wasted a day of my annual leave. The driver made another delivery date 9/7/12 and I have asked for previous delivery time of 11 am. However I have not received any confirmation and when I tried to check on ikea online delivery the system reports that no such order exists. I am now in a situation of either taking another day of annual leave tomorrow risking no show from the delivery. This is not a good experience at all!",Trustpilot_USA

At IKEA, wanted to buy a picture frame today but the one I wanted was out of stock and last one was on the wall so I asked assistant nearby if I could have the one on the wall and he replied - can't be bothered to get it down as it is too much troube for me to undo the screws as I will have to put another one on the wall so no you can't have it plus it won't scan anyway. I thought he was joking but he was deadly serious. There were 3 of them just standing around messing about so in that time he could easily have taken it down for me. How rude!

"Ikea - Kitchens . Purchased an ikea kitchen a year ago and it is the best kitchen I have ever had. A lot of people slag off flat pack kitchens, but I put it up correctly and employed a private chippy to put a worktop on and do the finishing touchers and it looks better than others in very expensive shops and show rooms. total cost for our large kitchen was less than £3K, fitted and finished (dont use ikea fitters as they are expensive - did most of it myself as its not brain surgery - and employ a good chippy to do the finishing touchers - save loads of money that way).
Ikea fitters wanted £3K to fit a £2K kitchen, thats just wrong.
Other kitchens by other companies of simular look (but in my opinion not as good quality were about £10K
I purchased the kitchen including appliances and paid a chippy and had change out of £3k",Trustpilot_USA

"IKEA Kitchen - very mixed results . My new IKEA kitchen is remarkable quality for the cost, but the good news stops there. Their estimator/designer made several mistakes with components that resulted in lots of unnecessary phone calls and visits to the store (a round trip of 140 miles each time). Plus they ""forgot"" to put our fridge freezer on the first delivery, sent the wrong plinths and shelves etc. But, absolutely the worst part of it was trying to get through to customer services on the phone. After waiting a long time in the queue, I was frequently just transferred back to switchboard to start all over again. On reflection, the quality and value for money just isn't worth the stress and inconvenience for such a major project. IKEA is fine for wee bits and pieces, but don't trust them with a major investment is my advice.",Trustpilot_USA

"At no point during the order process did ikea.co.uk live up to what we expect from an online retailer . The age of online shopping - it should be simple & easy. Ikea - it must be preferable to being herded around one of their cattle shed retail outlets, it has to be... I' rather spend a week lost in an Ikea store than go through the experience I've had with their astoundingly poor half-arsed online division.

Ordered two products. Rather surprised to hear it'd be 2-3 weeks before they would arrive - that's not what I'd expect from online purchasing but hey-ho, the order is placed, no going back now.

So 2.5 weeks pass, a driver calls to say he will be here within the hour, just as Ikea's text message said he would.

The items have been packed at the very front of the wagon. The wagon has two holes in the roof. The items are wet through and damaged. The items go back...

After several calls to Ikea, they finally 'phone back regarding the replacements: ""We will call you this afternoon to arrange re-delivery"". Eh? A call to say they will call? What's the point of that?

No call.

I called them back the next day, I'm told it'll be another 2-3 weeks before the replacements arrive.

2 and a bit weeks later we receive a call from the driver's mate - will be here in around an hour. Some minutes later, another call - ""I just noticed your items are packed at the front of the wagon - there is a hole in the roof, your items are both wet through""...

deja vu?!

Ikea wagon arrives, we tell the drivers they must have sent out the same items or used the same wagon again - they are strapped in at the far end of the wagon, the wagon has the same holes in the roof on either corner with all kinds of nasty green gunk where water has obviously been seeping through for many weeks or months.

The driver tells us that this is a common problem - their wagons are regularly damaged by trees, especially in Wales (?! Welsh trees must be tougher than our puny English ones, I dunno...)

So it seems to me, not only do Ikea have a very loose idea of what customers expect form an online shopping experience, they also have a fleet of (I'm told) 300 wagons, of which many have exactly the same defects as the two that attempted to deliver soggy chipboard shelving to our house.

So as it stands I'd rather risk buying some poorer quality Argos shelving than have anything to do with the Ikea brand ever again, I'd take Engrish flat-pack over Swedish soggy any day of the week.",Trustpilot_USA

"Ikea Croydon - avoid . Like others I've used Ikea in the past and been happy enough with the experience. However our local Croydon branch has now descended into a fleapit of dispair.

Walking through the unhelpfully signposted 3 miles of showrooms, most in a shabby state, we found the thing we were looking for and moved on to the warehouse to pick up the flat-pack box.

Having come prepared by checking online first that they had plenty of the item in stock, all we supposedly had to do was find which aisle it was located.

There were 4 touch screens at a help point to enable you to find things, but 3 of the 4 were broken (zero points for maintenance), and the 4th one only partly worked, and naturally suffered from crowds/queues. Once I got to the screen it indicated that iritatingly the item wasn't on the public shelves, so had to ask customer services. Randomly manned information desks reinforced this obvious lack of service, and was told to go somewhere else to ask for it to be retrieved from out back.

Landed in another long queue which initially wasn't manned at all, and only a passing staff member noticed that 10 people were angrily waiting. Staff scribbled numbers down on torn scraps of paper for more un-motivated staff to stroll slowly off and browse whilst the queue just got longer and longer.

About half an hour later I was then told that they did not have the item in stock and that they knew it shouldn't have been shown as in stock on their webpage.... This negligence and hopeless stock control underlines what a pointless waste of space this company has now become.

Key points
1. About as disorganised and mis-managed as a 50 pence bizzare, which ironcially it now so closely resembles.
2. Poorly maintained showroom, a shabby shadow of it's previous self 4-5 years ago
3. Poorly signposted and therefore painfully drags out the dire experience even longer
4. Unprofessional - you couldn't have paid to train an organisation to run so dis-functionally
5. Nasty, messy and tacky are all things which Ikea Croydon can only aspire to achieve, and has some way to go to reach these dizzying heights",Trustpilot_USA
